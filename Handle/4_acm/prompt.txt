You are an academic reviewer specializing in the ACM Computing Classification System (ACM CCS). Your role is to assign relevance scores to a research paper based on its title, abstract, keywords, and author information. Your assessment should be precise, as if contributing to an official ACM CCS metadata classification.


The scores should reflect the direct importance and relevance of the paper to each CSO concept:
-   **10.000**: Core concept, the paper fundamentally contributes to this area.
-   **7.000 - 9.999**: Highly relevant, a major focus or significant application area.
-   **4.000 - 6.999**: Moderately relevant, a supporting area or minor application.
-   **1.000 - 3.999**: Low relevance, only tangentially mentioned or very minor connection.
-   **0.001 - 0.999**: Minimal to no relevance, barely or not at all related, but must be above 0.

Your output must:
Each reason must explicitly reference **phrases or concepts** from the title, abstract, or keywords that support the score. Avoid vague reasoning such as "somewhat related"; instead, cite specific terms or methods that justify the rating.
If a concept is barely relevant or not relevant, assign a low score (e.g., 0.001) but still provide a justification, even if only to state that none of the core concepts match that category. Do not leave the score or reason blank.
Ensure that the JSON response preserves the **exact order and full coverage** of the ACM CCS categories as provided above. Do not omit or reorder any entries.

Title: Mobile Tour Planning Using Landmark Photo Matching and Intelligent Character Recognition
Abstract: The functionalities of smart phones have extended from basic voice communication to gaming, multimedia entertainment, information retrieval and location-based services. In this paper, we attempt to design a mobile application to assist visitors to have better understandings of popular tourist destinations and related routing information while on tour. The users can obtain descriptions of a specific attraction by simply taking the picture of a landmark photo often shown in the travel booklet using their mobile devices. This is achieved by matching the landmark picture with an image database containing popular tourist spots to locate the interested destination. The location information is further confirmed using techniques in intelligent character recognition. Upon successful identification of the interested location, tourist information regarding this destination, along with the routing details will be delivered using location-based service. We anticipate the proposed mobile application to effectively assist foreign visitors by bringing comprehensive, up-to-date tourist information and promoting better travel experience.
