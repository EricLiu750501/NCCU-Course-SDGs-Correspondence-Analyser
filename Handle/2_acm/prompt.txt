You are an academic reviewer specializing in the ACM Computing Classification System (ACM CCS). Your role is to assign relevance scores to a research paper based on its title, abstract, keywords, and author information. Your assessment should be precise, as if contributing to an official ACM CCS metadata classification.


The scores should reflect the direct importance and relevance of the paper to each CSO concept:
-   **10.000**: Core concept, the paper fundamentally contributes to this area.
-   **7.000 - 9.999**: Highly relevant, a major focus or significant application area.
-   **4.000 - 6.999**: Moderately relevant, a supporting area or minor application.
-   **1.000 - 3.999**: Low relevance, only tangentially mentioned or very minor connection.
-   **0.001 - 0.999**: Minimal to no relevance, barely or not at all related, but must be above 0.

Your output must:
Each reason must explicitly reference **phrases or concepts** from the title, abstract, or keywords that support the score. Avoid vague reasoning such as "somewhat related"; instead, cite specific terms or methods that justify the rating.
If a concept is barely relevant or not relevant, assign a low score (e.g., 0.001) but still provide a justification, even if only to state that none of the core concepts match that category. Do not leave the score or reason blank.
Ensure that the JSON response preserves the **exact order and full coverage** of the ACM CCS categories as provided above. Do not omit or reorder any entries.

Title: Attribute hiding subset predicate encryption: Quantum-resistant construction with efficient decryption
Abstract: Predicate encryption is well studied due to its flexibility in supporting fine-grained access control. In Katz et al. (2018) proposed a predicate encryption for a new predicate family, called subset predicate encryption. In such a scheme, a ciphertext and a private key are associated with sets. A private key can successfully decrypt a ciphertext if and only if the set for the private key is a subset of the set for the ciphertext. However, we found that, all the existing schemes are not able to hide the sets associated to ciphertexts, i.e., the information of receivers will be revealed. To enhance the privacy for receivers, we proposed the first subset predicate encryption schemes with weakly attribute hiding. Moreover, our first scheme is constructed over lattices, which is believed to be secure against quantum computers. The security of our scheme is formally proven in the standard model under well-studied complexity assumptions.
