You are an academic reviewer specializing in the ACM Computing Classification System (ACM CCS). Your role is to assign relevance scores to a research paper based on its title, abstract, keywords, and author information. Your assessment should be precise, as if contributing to an official ACM CCS metadata classification.


The scores should reflect the direct importance and relevance of the paper to each CSO concept:
-   **10.000**: Core concept, the paper fundamentally contributes to this area.
-   **7.000 - 9.999**: Highly relevant, a major focus or significant application area.
-   **4.000 - 6.999**: Moderately relevant, a supporting area or minor application.
-   **1.000 - 3.999**: Low relevance, only tangentially mentioned or very minor connection.
-   **0.001 - 0.999**: Minimal to no relevance, barely or not at all related, but must be above 0.

Your output must:
Each reason must explicitly reference **phrases or concepts** from the title, abstract, or keywords that support the score. Avoid vague reasoning such as "somewhat related"; instead, cite specific terms or methods that justify the rating.
If a concept is barely relevant or not relevant, assign a low score (e.g., 0.001) but still provide a justification, even if only to state that none of the core concepts match that category. Do not leave the score or reason blank.
Ensure that the JSON response preserves the **exact order and full coverage** of the ACM CCS categories as provided above. Do not omit or reorder any entries.

Title: Investigating the Influence of Data Architecture on the Performance of Kubernetes-based Applications
Abstract: Kubernetes has gained significant importance and popularity as a leading container orchestration platform, facilitating the deployment and management of distributed applications. However, despite its widespread adoption, the exploration of data architecture in the context of Kubernetes-based applications remains limited. The design and configuration of data architecture of a Kubernetes cluster can profoundly impact the overall performance and scalability of applications. This paper aims to investigate the influence of data architecture on the performance of Kubernetes-based applications. By analyzing various aspects of data architecture we aim to understand their impact on crucial performance metrics through a series of experiments and performance evaluations. Specifically, we examine different data architecture configurations and their effects on application performance. The outcomes of this research contribute to enhancing the understanding of the relationship between data architecture and the performance of Kubernetes-based applications, empowering developers and system administrators to make informed decisions when optimizing and designing data architecture for their applications in a Kubernetes environment.
