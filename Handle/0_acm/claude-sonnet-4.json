{
   "General and reference": {
       "reason": "This paper does not focus on general computing concepts, surveys, or reference materials. The research is specifically targeted at 'data architecture' and 'Kubernetes-based applications' performance, making it highly specialized rather than general reference material.",
       "score": 0.500
   },
   "Hardware": {
       "reason": "While the paper mentions 'storage' in keywords and data architecture may involve hardware considerations, the focus is on software-level 'container orchestration' and 'Kubernetes' platform configurations rather than hardware design or evaluation.",
       "score": 2.500
   },
   "Computer systems organization": {
       "reason": "This category is highly relevant as the paper focuses on 'container orchestration', 'Kubernetes cluster' configuration, 'distributed applications', and 'cloud native systems'. These directly relate to computer systems organization, distributed systems architecture, and system performance optimization.",
       "score": 9.200
   },
   "Networks": {
       "reason": "The paper mentions 'distributed applications' and 'Kubernetes cluster' which inherently involve networking components, but the primary focus is on 'data architecture' and performance rather than network protocols, communication, or network-specific optimizations.",
       "score": 3.800
   },
   "Software and its engineering": {
       "reason": "This is a core category as the paper investigates 'container orchestration', 'Kubernetes-based applications', software 'deployment and management', and focuses on software system 'performance and scalability'. The author expertise includes '軟體工程' (software engineering), directly aligning with this category.",
       "score": 9.800
   },
   "Theory of computation": {
       "reason": "The paper is empirical, focusing on 'experiments and performance evaluations' of practical systems rather than theoretical computational models, algorithms, or computational complexity theory.",
       "score": 0.800
   },
   "Mathematics of computing": {
       "reason": "While 'performance metrics' and evaluations may involve mathematical analysis, the paper's core contribution is in system architecture and performance optimization rather than mathematical computing methods or algorithms.",
       "score": 1.200
   },
   "Information systems": {
       "reason": "The paper addresses 'data architecture' and 'storage' which are fundamental information systems concepts. The focus on data organization and management within 'Kubernetes clusters' relates to information systems design and data management.",
       "score": 7.500
   },
   "Security and privacy": {
       "reason": "The paper focuses on 'performance' and 'data architecture' optimization without mentioning security concerns, privacy issues, or security-related aspects of Kubernetes deployments.",
       "score": 0.300
   },
   "Human-centered computing": {
       "reason": "The research is focused on system-level 'performance' and technical 'data architecture' rather than user interfaces, human-computer interaction, or user experience aspects.",
       "score": 0.200
   },
   "Computing methodologies": {
       "reason": "The paper employs 'experiments and performance evaluations' as research methodology, but the core contribution is in systems performance rather than developing new computing methodologies or algorithms.",
       "score": 2.800
   },
   "Applied computing": {
       "reason": "This paper represents applied research in 'cloud native systems' and practical 'Kubernetes' deployment optimization. It addresses real-world application performance issues and provides practical insights for 'developers and system administrators'.",
       "score": 8.400
   },
   "Social and professional topics": {
       "reason": "The paper mentions helping 'developers and system administrators to make informed decisions' but does not address social implications, professional development, or broader societal impacts of the technology.",
