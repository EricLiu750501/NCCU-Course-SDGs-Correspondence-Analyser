{
    "A.: General and reference": {
        "reason": "The paper does not engage with general computing concepts such as surveys, general literature reviews, or reference methodologies. It focuses narrowly on Kubernetes and data architecture.",
        "score": 0.500
    },
    "B.: Hardware": {
        "reason": "There is no mention of physical hardware design, architecture, or hardware-related performance tuning; the work is situated entirely within software and container orchestration frameworks.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "C.: Computer systems organization": {
        "reason": "The paper directly investigates 'data architecture of a Kubernetes cluster' and its impact on 'performance and scalability of applications', which fits within distributed architectures and performance evaluation in systems organization.",
        "score": 9.200
    },
    "D.: Networks": {
        "reason": "Although Kubernetes can have implications for networking, the paper does not address network protocols, communication performance, or networked systems. The focus is on data architecture at the application level.",
        "score": 2.500
    },
    "E.: Software and its engineering": {
        "reason": "The study focuses on software configuration and deployment within Kubernetes, aligning with areas such as software architectures, system software, and deployment management, especially in 'cloud native systems'.",
        "score": 8.500
    },
    "F.: Theory of computation": {
        "reason": "No theoretical models, algorithms, or formal computation theories are discussed; the paper is empirical and systems-oriented.",
        "score": 0.100
    },
    "G.: Mathematics of computing": {
        "reason": "No mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, or formal methods are presented in the work. Performance evaluation is empirical rather than mathematical.",
        "score": 0.200
    },
    "H.: Information systems": {
        "reason": "There is mention of 'data architecture' and 'storage', but the context is more about system performance rather than databases, information retrieval, or data management at an IS level.",
        "score": 3.000
    },
    "I.: Security and privacy": {
        "reason": "Security concerns such as access control, container isolation, or privacy are not discussed in the abstract or keywords.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "J.: Human-centered computing": {
        "reason": "The paper does not discuss usability, user interfaces, or human interaction with the system; it targets developers and system administrators in a technical context.",
        "score": 0.300
    },
    "K.: Computing methodologies": {
        "reason": "While some experimentation is conducted, there is no focus on modeling, machine learning, or simulation techniques that typically define this category.",
        "score": 1.000
    },
    "L.: Applied computing": {
        "reason": "The work has practical implications for 'developers and system administrators' in 'cloud native systems', indicating a moderate applied computing relevance.",
        "score": 4.500
    },
    "M.: Social and professional topics": {
        "reason": "There is no discussion of ethics, education, policy, or professional practice beyond mentioning roles such as developers or administrators.",
