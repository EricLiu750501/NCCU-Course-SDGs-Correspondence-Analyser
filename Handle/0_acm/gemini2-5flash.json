  "A.: General and reference": {
    "reason": "The paper does not directly contribute to general reference works or survey computing topics broadly. Its focus is on a specific technical investigation within computing.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "B.: Hardware": {
    "reason": "The paper focuses on software aspects (Kubernetes, data architecture, performance of applications) and distributed systems, not on the design, analysis, or specific characteristics of computer hardware.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "C.: Computer systems organization": {
    "reason": "The paper investigates 'Kubernetes-based applications' and 'distributed applications' and their 'data architecture' within a 'Kubernetes cluster', all of which directly relate to the organization and architecture of computer systems, specifically distributed systems and their underlying infrastructure for performance optimization.",
    "score": 9.500
  },
  "D.: Networks": {
    "reason": "While Kubernetes and distributed applications inherently rely on networking, the paper's explicit focus is on 'data architecture' and its 'influence...on performance', rather than network protocols, topologies, or specific network performance issues. Networking is an underlying support, not the primary subject of investigation.",
    "score": 4.000
  },
  "E.: Software and its engineering": {
    "reason": "The core of the paper is about 'Kubernetes', a 'container orchestration platform', and the 'design and configuration of data architecture' for 'Kubernetes-based applications'. This directly falls under software design, development, and performance engineering of complex software systems.",
    "score": 10.000
  },
  "F.: Theory of computation": {
    "reason": "The paper is an experimental investigation into practical performance aspects of a specific software platform (Kubernetes) and data architectures. It does not deal with theoretical computer science, algorithms, complexity, or formal methods.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "G.: Mathematics of computing": {
    "reason": "The paper involves 'performance evaluations' and 'analyzing various aspects' which might involve statistical analysis, but it does not focus on the mathematical foundations, computational mathematics, or numerical analysis as a primary research area.",
    "score": 1.000
  },
  "H.: Information systems": {
    "reason": "The paper investigates 'data architecture' and its impact on 'application performance' in the context of 'distributed applications' and 'cloud native systems', which are fundamental components of modern information systems, particularly regarding data management and scalability.",
    "score": 8.000
  },
  "I.: Security and privacy": {
    "reason": "The paper's focus is exclusively on 'performance' and 'scalability' concerning 'data architecture' in Kubernetes. There is no mention or investigation of security vulnerabilities, privacy concerns, or security mechanisms.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "J.: Human-centered computing": {
    "reason": "The research focuses on the technical performance of software systems and infrastructure ('Kubernetes-based applications', 'data architecture'). It does not involve human-computer interaction, user studies, accessibility, or social computing aspects.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "K.: Computing methodologies": {
    "reason": "The paper employs 'experiments and performance evaluations' as a methodology to investigate the impact of 'data architecture' on 'application performance'. This aligns with experimental analysis and performance modeling within computing methodologies.",
    "score": 6.500
  },
  "L.: Applied computing": {
    "reason": "The paper addresses practical challenges and provides insights for 'developers and system administrators' to 'optimize and design data architecture' for 'applications in a Kubernetes environment'. This signifies a clear application-oriented research contribution in a specific domain (cloud-native applications). The keyword 'cloud native systems' also reinforces its applied nature.",
    "score": 7.500
  },
  "M.: Social and professional topics": {
    "reason": "The paper is a technical investigation into software performance and architecture. It does not address social impacts of computing, professional ethics, computing education, or other social and professional topics.",
