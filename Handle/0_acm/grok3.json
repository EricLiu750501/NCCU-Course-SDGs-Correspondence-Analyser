{
    "A.: General and reference": {
        "reason": "The paper focuses on empirical analysis and performance evaluation of Kubernetes-based applications, which aligns with general experimental studies in computing. However, it does not broadly cover reference materials or surveys, limiting its relevance.",
        "score": 4.000
    },
    "B.: Hardware": {
        "reason": "The paper does not discuss hardware components or configurations directly, focusing instead on data architecture and software-level performance in Kubernetes. No hardware-specific terms appear in the title, abstract, or keywords.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "C.: Computer systems organization": {
        "reason": "The paper investigates data architecture in Kubernetes, a container orchestration platform central to distributed systems and cloud computing. Terms like 'Kubernetes,' 'container orchestration,' and 'cloud native systems' indicate a strong focus on system organization.",
        "score": 9.000
    },
    "D.: Networks": {
        "reason": "While Kubernetes operates in networked environments, the paper does not explicitly address network protocols, topologies, or performance. The focus is on data architecture, with no network-specific terms in the title, abstract, or keywords.",
        "score": 1.000
    },
    "E.: Software and its engineering": {
        "reason": "The paper directly addresses software design and performance in Kubernetes-based applications, with keywords like 'container,' 'container orchestration,' and 'cloud native systems.' The second author's expertise in 'Cloud Native系統' and '軟體工程' reinforces this relevance.",
        "score": 10.000
    },
    "F.: Theory of computation": {
        "reason": "The paper is empirical, focusing on performance evaluations rather than theoretical models or algorithms. No terms related to computational theory appear in the title, abstract, or keywords.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "G.: Mathematics of computing": {
        "reason": "The paper involves performance metrics, which may implicitly use basic statistical analysis, but no explicit mathematical methods or models are mentioned in the title, abstract, or keywords.",
        "score": 2.000
    },
    "H.: Information systems": {
        "reason": "The paper examines data architecture, which relates to data management in information systems. Keywords like 'storage' and 'data architecture' suggest moderate relevance, but the primary focus is on Kubernetes performance, not core information systems concepts.",
        "score": 6.000
    },
    "I.: Security and privacy": {
        "reason": "The paper does not address security or privacy concerns, focusing solely on performance and data architecture in Kubernetes. No related terms appear in the title, abstract, or keywords.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "J.: Human-centered computing": {
        "reason": "The paper aims to empower developers and administrators with insights, but it does not focus on user interfaces, usability, or human-computer interaction. No human-centered terms are present in the title, abstract, or keywords.",
        "score": 1.000
    },
    "K.: Computing methodologies": {
        "reason": "The paper uses experimental methodologies to evaluate performance, but it does not focus on computational techniques like machine learning or algorithms. The empirical approach is secondary to the system design focus.",
        "score": 4.000
    },
    "L.: Applied computing": {
        "reason": "The paper applies computing concepts to optimize Kubernetes-based applications, with practical implications for cloud systems. Keywords like 'cloud native systems' and the focus on real-world performance suggest moderate relevance.",
        "score": 6.000
    },
    "M.: Social and professional topics": {
        "reason": "While the paper may indirectly inform professional practices in system administration, it does not address social or professional issues directly. No related terms appear in the title, abstract, or keywords.",
        "score": 1.000
