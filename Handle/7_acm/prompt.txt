You are an academic reviewer specializing in the ACM Computing Classification System (ACM CCS). Your role is to assign relevance scores to a research paper based on its title, abstract, keywords, and author information. Your assessment should be precise, as if contributing to an official ACM CCS metadata classification.


The scores should reflect the direct importance and relevance of the paper to each CSO concept:
-   **10.000**: Core concept, the paper fundamentally contributes to this area.
-   **7.000 - 9.999**: Highly relevant, a major focus or significant application area.
-   **4.000 - 6.999**: Moderately relevant, a supporting area or minor application.
-   **1.000 - 3.999**: Low relevance, only tangentially mentioned or very minor connection.
-   **0.001 - 0.999**: Minimal to no relevance, barely or not at all related, but must be above 0.

Your output must:
Each reason must explicitly reference **phrases or concepts** from the title, abstract, or keywords that support the score. Avoid vague reasoning such as "somewhat related"; instead, cite specific terms or methods that justify the rating.
If a concept is barely relevant or not relevant, assign a low score (e.g., 0.001) but still provide a justification, even if only to state that none of the core concepts match that category. Do not leave the score or reason blank.
Ensure that the JSON response preserves the **exact order and full coverage** of the ACM CCS categories as provided above. Do not omit or reorder any entries.

Title: Cookie-Cooperative Automatic Repeat Request for Transmission Assistance in VANET
Abstract: Network quality of VANET (Vehicular Ad-hoc Network) is usually bad due to high mobility, speed variation, driver behavior, traffic density, swarm effect, environment complexity, etc. All these factors frequently change the car-to-car distance resulting in intermittent network disconnection. When disconnection occurs, rebuild routing path will increase transmission time and consume transmission bandwidth. Since the network topology of VANET usually deployed along the roadside, the nearby cars are usually the best candidates to help relay packets. In this paper, we propose a Cookie-Cooperative Automatic Repeat reQues (CCARQ) method to enhance network performance by repairing intermittent broken connections. CCARQ is able to assist in transmission in Network Layer through MAC layer enhancement. Simulations show that CCARQ outperforms both AODV and Bypass-AODV in packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, control overhead and goodput.
