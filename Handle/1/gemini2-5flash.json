 "Broad Domain": "Computer Science",
 "CSO Concepts": {
  "artificial intelligence": {
   "reason": "The paper mentions a 'prioritized most likelihood movement model to prefetch potential future objects based on the user’s current motion intention', which has a tangential connection to predictive modeling or user behavior analysis often found in AI, but it's not a core AI research paper.",

  },
  "computer imaging and vision": {
   "reason": "The paper deals with 'transmitted geometry data' and 'large virtual environments', which are rendered and visualized, implying a connection to computer imaging. However, it's not focused on image processing or computer vision algorithms.",
   "score": 4.500
  },
  "computer networks": {
   "reason": "The paper explicitly mentions 'client-server architecture' and 'reducing the amount of transmitted geometry data', indicating a direct relevance to network communication and optimization in a distributed environment.",

  "computer systems": {
   "reason": "The paper proposes a 'data management scheme' and discusses 'client-server architecture' and 'managing the computing resources on the client side', which are core aspects of computer systems design and optimization for performance.",
   "score": 9.500
  },
  "data mining": {
   "reason": "The paper focuses on data management, prefetching, and caching within virtual environments, not on extracting patterns or knowledge from large datasets, thus having minimal relevance to data mining.",
   "score": 1.000
  },
  "human computer interaction": {
   "reason": "The paper aims to 'maintain the quality of a walkthrough experience' and considers 'user’s current motion intention', directly addressing the user's experience and interaction within a virtual environment.",
   "score": 7.500
  },
  "information retrieval": {
   "reason": "The paper discusses prefetching and caching of 'potential future objects' and 'spatial data management', which involve efficient access to information, aligning moderately with information retrieval principles.",
   "score": 4.000

  "information technology": {
   "reason": "The paper presents a technical solution for managing data in complex virtual environments, which is a practical application within the broader field of information technology.",
   "score": 6.000
  },
  "internet": {
   "reason": "The mention of 'client-server architecture' for virtual environments implies the use of network infrastructure, which often involves internet protocols and technologies, giving it moderate relevance.",
   "score": 4.500
  },
  "operating systems": {
   "reason": "While 'managing computing resources on the client side' could involve operating system level functionalities, the paper does not specifically delve into operating system design or features, making its relevance indirect and low.",
   "score": 2.000
  },
  "pattern matching": {
   "reason": "The 'prioritized most likelihood movement model' could involve identifying patterns in user movement, suggesting a minor connection to pattern matching, but it's not a central theme.",

  },
  "software engineering": {
   "reason": "The paper proposes a structured 'data management scheme' with specific techniques ('real-time scene management', 'movement model', 'hybrid coherence cache model') designed to improve system effectiveness and maintain quality, which falls under software engineering principles for building robust and efficient systems.",
   "score": 8.500
  },
  "theoretical computer science": {
   "reason": "The paper focuses on practical solutions and experimental demonstrations for data management in virtual environments, rather than exploring foundational or abstract computational theories, making its relevance minimal.",
