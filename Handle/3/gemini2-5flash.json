    },
    "computer security": {
      "reason": "The core of the paper addresses 'encrypted data', 'data leakage', 'privacy of data', and provides 'formal proof to verify the security of our proposed'. This is a fundamental contribution to computer security.",

    "pattern matching": {
      "reason": "While keyword search can be seen as a form of pattern matching, the paper's emphasis is on the cryptographic scheme enabling the search over encrypted data, not on generic pattern matching algorithms.",
