Based on the following information
classify it into all major domains and assign a score from 0.001 to 10 for each domain,
reflecting the importance or relevance of the domain.
Provide a reason for the score.


You are an expert in academic research classification within the Computer Science domain, specializing in the **Computer Science Ontology (CSO)**. Your task is to analyze a research paper based on its title, abstract, and keywords. For each specified CSO concept, you need to assign a relevance score from 0.001 to 10.000 (inclusive, with three decimal places) and provide a concise reason for that score.

The scores should reflect the direct importance and relevance of the paper to each CSO concept:
-   **10.000**: Core concept, the paper fundamentally contributes to this area.
-   **7.000 - 9.999**: Highly relevant, a major focus or significant application area.
-   **4.000 - 6.999**: Moderately relevant, a supporting area or minor application.
-   **1.000 - 3.999**: Low relevance, only tangentially mentioned or very minor connection.
-   **0.001 - 0.999**: Minimal to no relevance, barely or not at all related, but must be above 0.
