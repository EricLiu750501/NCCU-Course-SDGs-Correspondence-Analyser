    "General and reference": {
        "reason": "The paper does not address general computing concepts, reference materials, or meta-topics about computing. It focuses specifically on technical networking protocols rather than broad foundational computing principles.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Hardware": {
        "reason": "The paper mentions 'USRP N200' prototype implementation and discusses 'antenna AP scenarios', indicating hardware components are involved in the experimental validation, but the core contribution is protocol design rather than hardware innovation.",

    },
    "Computer systems organization": {
        "reason": "The paper addresses 'MU-MIMO MAC protocols' and '802.11 CSMA/CA' which are fundamental components of computer system organization at the network layer, involving how systems coordinate and organize communication.",

        "reason": "This is the core focus area. The paper directly addresses '802.11 Multiuser MIMO Networks', 'MU-MIMO LANs', 'MAC protocols', 'channel characteristics', and 'concurrent transmission opportunities' - all fundamental networking concepts.",

    },
    "Theory of computation": {
        "reason": "While the paper involves 'user matching' algorithms and optimization for 'channel orthogonality', the theoretical computational aspects are secondary to the practical networking protocol design and implementation.",

    },
    "Mathematics of computing": {
        "reason": "The paper involves mathematical concepts in 'channel characteristics' analysis and optimization for throughput gains, but mathematical computing is not the primary contribution or focus area.",

    "Security and privacy": {
        "reason": "The paper does not address security protocols, privacy concerns, or cryptographic aspects. The focus is on throughput optimization and fairness in wireless networks rather than security mechanisms.",
        "score": 0.001

    "Human-centered computing": {
        "reason": "The paper does not address user interfaces, human-computer interaction, or user experience. It focuses on technical protocol optimization rather than human-centered design considerations.",

    "Computing methodologies": {
        "reason": "While the paper involves algorithmic approaches for 'user matching' and protocol design methodologies, it does not primarily contribute to general computing methodologies or AI/ML techniques.",

    "Applied computing": {
        "reason": "The paper demonstrates practical application through 'prototype implementation' and shows 'throughput gain' results, representing applied research in wireless networking, though networking is the primary domain.",
