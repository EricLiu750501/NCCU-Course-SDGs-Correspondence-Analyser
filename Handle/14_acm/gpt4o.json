    "General and reference": {
        "reason": "The paper does not address overarching conceptual frameworks, documentation, or survey-style methodologies typically associated with this category.",
        "score": 0.100
    },
    "Hardware": {
        "reason": "While the paper mentions a prototype implemented with USRP N200, it focuses on MAC protocol design rather than hardware architecture, design, or performance at the circuit or device level.",
        "score": 1.500
    },
    "Computer systems organization": {
        "reason": "The work addresses MAC-level protocol design and system-level behavior in wireless networks, particularly in managing concurrent streams, which ties moderately to system architecture and design within communication subsystems.",
        "score": 5.500
    },
    "Networks": {
        "reason": "This is the paper's core focus. It introduces a new MAC protocol (MIMOMate) for 802.11 MU-MIMO LANs, optimizing channel access and user matching based on channel characteristics and fairness, directly targeting wireless network protocol efficiency.",
        "score": 10.000
    },
    "Software and its engineering": {
        "reason": "Although the protocol is implemented as software and interacts with network stacks, the core contribution is not to software design or engineering methods, but rather to network protocol design.",
        "score": 2.000
    },
    "Theory of computation": {
        "reason": "The paper does not contribute theoretical models or complexity analyses; instead, it is focused on empirical evaluation and system design.",
        "score": 0.500
    },
    "Mathematics of computing": {
        "reason": "Mathematical analysis is implicit in concepts like 'channel orthogonality' and 'user matching', but no explicit mathematical modeling or algorithms are a primary focus.",
        "score": 1.000
    },
    "Information systems": {
        "reason": "The paper does not address topics like data management, retrieval, databases, or web systems, which are central to this category.",
        "score": 0.200
    },
    "Security and privacy": {
        "reason": "Security aspects such as authentication, encryption, or privacy are not discussed in the design or evaluation of the proposed protocol.",
        "score": 0.100
    },
    "Human-centered computing": {
        "reason": "The paper is entirely focused on MAC protocols and throughput optimization in wireless networks, without any user interface, accessibility, or HCI component.",
        "score": 0.050
    },
    "Computing methodologies": {
        "reason": "The study includes empirical evaluation and protocol design but does not contribute new computing paradigms, learning methods, or simulation frameworks typical of this category.",
        "score": 1.200
    },
    "Applied computing": {
        "reason": "There is application relevance in terms of wireless LAN optimization and backward compatibility with legacy 802.11 devices, which reflects moderate applied computing interest.",

        "reason": "The paper does not address ethical, legal, professional, or social implications of computing technologies.",
