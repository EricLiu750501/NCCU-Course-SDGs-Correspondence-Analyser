{
    "General and reference": {
        "reason": "The paper discusses general methods for optical character recognition and reading order detection, which are cross-disciplinary techniques applicable to cultural preservation and digitization. The focus on 'heritage preservation' and 'digitized documents' aligns with general computing applications, but it is not a core contribution to this category.",
        "score": 4.000
    },
    "Hardware": {
        "reason": "The paper does not mention hardware-specific concepts or contributions. It focuses on software-based methods like block-based models and learning-to-rank for reading order detection, with no reference to hardware design or optimization.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computer systems organization": {
        "reason": "The paper's focus is on software algorithms for reading order detection and OCR, with no discussion of computer systems organization such as system architectures or embedded systems.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Networks": {
        "reason": "There is no mention of network-related concepts, such as data transmission or network protocols, in the title, abstract, or keywords. The work is centered on document processing and analysis.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Software and its engineering": {
        "reason": "The paper describes a block-based approach for reading order detection, implemented as a software solution. Terms like 'block-based models,' 'learning-to-rank,' and 'prototype' indicate a significant focus on software development and algorithms, making this a major area of contribution.",
        "score": 8.500
    },
    "Theory of computation": {
        "reason": "While the paper mentions 'learning-to-rank' and compares against n-gram models, the theoretical aspects are not the primary focus. These methods are applied practically rather than explored for their theoretical foundations.",
        "score": 3.000
    },
    "Mathematics of computing": {
        "reason": "The use of 'learning-to-rank' and evaluation metrics like position error rate (PER) suggests some mathematical modeling. However, the paper does not emphasize mathematical theory or derivations, focusing instead on practical application.",
        "score": 4.000
    },
    "Information systems": {
        "reason": "The paper directly contributes to information systems through 'optical character recognition' and 'reading order detection' for processing archival documents. Keywords like 'document layout analysis' and 'archival document processing' indicate a core focus on information retrieval and processing systems.",
        "score": 10.000
    },
    "Security and privacy": {
        "reason": "There is no mention of security or privacy-related concepts in the paper’s title, abstract, or keywords. The focus is on document processing, not data protection or secure systems.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Human-centered computing": {
        "reason": "The paper addresses 'heritage preservation' and 'cultural preservation,' which relate to human-centered goals in digitizing classical Chinese documents. The reduction of 'post-OCR human labor' also suggests a human-centered application, but this is a secondary focus compared to the technical methods.",
        "score": 6.000
    },
    "Computing methodologies": {
        "reason": "The paper’s core contribution lies in 'block-based models' and 'learning-to-rank' for reading order detection, which are machine learning and computational techniques. Keywords like 'pairwise sorting' and 'multimodal representation' further align with computing methodologies, making this a highly relevant area.",
        "score": 9.000
    },
    "Applied computing": {
        "reason": "The paper applies computing techniques to 'archival document processing' and 'heritage preservation,' specifically for classical Chinese documents. The demonstration of a prototype at AAAI and its extensibility to Japanese texts highlight its applied nature in digital humanities.",
        "score": 7.500
    },
    "Social and professional topics": {
        "reason": "While the paper supports 'cultural preservation,' which has social implications, it does not directly address social or professional issues in computing, such as ethics or education. The connection is tangential through the cultural context.",
