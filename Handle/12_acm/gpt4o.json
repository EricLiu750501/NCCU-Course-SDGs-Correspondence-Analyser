    "General and reference": {
        "reason": "The paper addresses general methodological concerns relevant to OCR and cultural preservation, such as 'texts...are the most important form of cultural preservation' and the practical demonstration at AAAI, touching on general academic and archival relevance.",
        "score": 4.200
    },
    "Hardware": {
        "reason": "There is no mention of hardware systems, device architectures, or physical components related to OCR or reading order detection in the paper.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computer systems organization": {
        "reason": "The paper does not discuss system-level architecture, distributed systems, or embedded systems; it focuses on software-level layout and learning techniques.",
        "score": 0.500
    },
    "Networks": {
        "reason": "No reference is made to computer or communication networks, protocols, or distributed processing; the content is not network-related.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Software and its engineering": {
        "reason": "The paper describes the development of a 'fully functioning prototype' and compares model implementations such as rule-based, MLP, and heuristic methods, aligning with practical software engineering and evaluation.",
        "score": 6.500
    },
    "Theory of computation": {
        "reason": "While the paper references models like learning-to-rank, it does not engage with formal languages, automata theory, or complexityâ€”key areas in the theory of computation.",
        "score": 1.200
    },
    "Mathematics of computing": {
        "reason": "The paper touches on 'pairwise sorting' and 'learning-to-rank', which involve algorithmic and statistical computation, but it does not dive deeply into theoretical or numerical methods.",
        "score": 3.000
    },
    "Information systems": {
        "reason": "The system processes archival documents, aligning with 'document layout analysis' and 'archival document processing', which are relevant to information organization and retrieval.",
        "score": 7.000
    },
    "Security and privacy": {
        "reason": "No mention is made of encryption, access control, or privacy-preserving computation. OCR and layout analysis are unrelated to this category.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Human-centered computing": {
        "reason": "By reducing 'the cost of post-OCR human labor', the system aims to improve human interaction with digital documents, which slightly relates to usability and accessibility concerns.",
        "score": 4.800
    },
    "Computing methodologies": {
        "reason": "The core contribution involves 'block-based models', 'learning-to-rank', and performance evaluations, making this a fundamental contribution in machine learning and pattern recognition methods.",
        "score": 10.000
    },
    "Applied computing": {
        "reason": "The work has a direct application in 'heritage preservation' and 'archival document processing', particularly for 'classical Chinese documents', a strong example of computing in arts and humanities.",
        "score": 9.000
    },
    "Social and professional topics": {
        "reason": "The paper implies cultural preservation as a motivation, but lacks direct engagement with ethical, legal, or societal impact discussions.",
        "score": 2.500
    }
