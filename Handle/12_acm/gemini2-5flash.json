  "General and reference": {
    "reason": "The paper discusses 'cultural preservation' and 'heritage preservation' of 'classical Chinese documents', which relates to the general application and societal impact of computing, aligning with the 'General and reference' category's scope regarding computing in society and humanities. The 'expertise' of one author includes '數位人文' (Digital Humanities), which falls under this broad category.",
    "score": 4.500
  },
  "Hardware": {
    "reason": "The paper focuses on 'optical character recognition (OCR)' and its algorithms for 'reading order detection', which are software and algorithmic problems. There is no mention of hardware components, design, or performance in the title, abstract, or keywords.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "Computer systems organization": {
    "reason": "The paper primarily deals with algorithms and their application for 'reading order detection' within OCR. It does not discuss the architecture, design, or organization of computer systems, such as processors, memory, or distributed systems.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "Networks": {
    "reason": "The paper's content is entirely focused on 'optical character recognition (OCR)', 'reading order detection', and 'document layout analysis'. There is no mention of network protocols, communication, distributed systems, or network security.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "Software and its engineering": {
    "reason": "The paper reports on a 'block-based approach' for 'reading order detection' and mentions 'implementing and demonstrated a fully functioning prototype'. This directly involves the design, implementation, and evaluation of software systems, fitting within 'Software and its engineering'.",
    "score": 7.500
  },
  "Theory of computation": {
    "reason": "While the paper develops an algorithm for 'reading order detection' based on 'learning-to-rank', it focuses on the practical application and experimental results rather than the theoretical foundations of computation, complexity theory, or formal languages. The mention of 'n-gram models' and 'rule-based' approaches are related to computational methods but not the theoretical underpinnings of computation itself.",
    "score": 3.000
  },
  "Mathematics of computing": {
    "reason": "The paper describes an algorithm for 'reading order detection' and uses quantitative evaluation metrics like 'position error rate (PER)'. The approach is based on 'learning-to-rank', which has mathematical foundations. The mention of 'n-gram models' also implies statistical or probabilistic underpinnings. However, the paper doesn't delve into the mathematical theories or models themselves, but rather applies computational methods.",
    "score": 4.000
  },
  "Information systems": {
    "reason": "The paper deals with 'digitized documents' and 'lasting storage' of 'cultural preservation' information, which aligns with the management and processing of information. 'Optical character recognition (OCR)' and 'Archival document processing' are core to information retrieval, document management, and information storage systems.",
    "score": 7.000
  },
  "Security and privacy": {
    "reason": "The paper focuses on 'optical character recognition (OCR)' and 'reading order detection' for 'classical Chinese documents'. There is no mention of data security, privacy, encryption, or access control mechanisms in the context of the processed documents or the systems involved.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "Human-centered computing": {
    "reason": "The paper addresses 'reducing the cost of post-OCR human labor for correction' and aims to improve the usability of digitized documents. This directly impacts human interaction with and processing of information, linking to the user experience aspects of computing. The 'expertise' of one author in '數位人文' (Digital Humanities) also connects to how humans interact with and benefit from computational tools in humanities research.",
    "score": 5.500
  },
  "Computing methodologies": {
    "reason": "The paper proposes a 'block-based approach' for 'reading order detection', identifies 'text blocks', and orders them based on 'learning-to-rank'. It also mentions 'rule-based and n-gram models' and evaluates using 'experimental results'. This demonstrates a clear focus on developing and evaluating computational methods and algorithms, especially within the domains of 'Optical character recognition (OCR)' and 'Document layout analysis'. The author's expertise in '人工智慧' (Artificial Intelligence) reinforces this relevance.",
    "score": 10.000
  },
  "Applied computing": {
    "reason": "The paper's core application is 'optical character recognition (OCR)' for 'classical Chinese documents' for 'heritage preservation' and 'cultural preservation'. This is a direct application of computing techniques to a specific domain. The mention of 'Archival document processing' and the extensibility to 'Japanese texts' further highlight the practical application of the developed methods.",
    "score": 9.500
  },
  "Social and professional topics": {
    "reason": "The paper's motivation stems from the importance of 'cultural preservation' and 'heritage preservation' through 'digitized documents'. While the core of the paper is technical, the societal impact of preserving historical texts and the reduction of 'human labor for correction' touch upon professional practices and the broader societal role of computing in humanities and archival work. The author's expertise in '數位人文' (Digital Humanities) also points to a social and professional context.",
