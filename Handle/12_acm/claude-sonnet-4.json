{
    "General and reference": {
        "reason": "The paper mentions 'heritage preservation' and 'cultural preservation' but focuses on technical methodology rather than general reference topics. The work is specific to OCR applications rather than broad reference material.",
        "score": 1.500
    },
    "Hardware": {
        "reason": "No mention of hardware design, computer architecture, or hardware-specific implementations. The paper focuses on algorithmic approaches for document processing without hardware considerations.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computer systems organization": {
        "reason": "The paper does not address system architecture, distributed systems, or organizational aspects of computing systems. Focus is on algorithm design rather than system organization.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Networks": {
        "reason": "No discussion of networking, communication protocols, or network-based systems. The work is focused on local document processing without network components.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Software and its engineering": {
        "reason": "The paper describes 'implemented and demonstrated a fully functioning prototype' and discusses algorithmic approaches, but the primary focus is on the methodology rather than software engineering practices or development processes.",
        "score": 3.200
    },
    "Theory of computation": {
        "reason": "The work involves 'learning-to-rank' algorithms and 'pairwise sorting' which are computational theory concepts, but these are applied rather than theoretical contributions to computation theory itself.",
        "score": 4.500
    },
    "Mathematics of computing": {
        "reason": "The paper uses mathematical approaches like 'learning-to-rank' and discusses 'position error rate (PER)' metrics and comparative statistical analysis, indicating moderate mathematical computing involvement.",
        "score": 5.800
    },
    "Information systems": {
        "reason": "The work involves 'document layout analysis', 'archival document processing', and converting 'hard-copy forms to digitized documents' which are core information systems applications for digital libraries and document management.",
        "score": 8.500
    },
    "Security and privacy": {
        "reason": "No discussion of security measures, privacy protection, or cryptographic methods. The focus is entirely on document processing accuracy rather than security concerns.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Human-centered computing": {
        "reason": "The paper mentions reducing 'post-OCR human labor for correction' and focuses on improving user experience in document digitization, but this is a secondary benefit rather than a primary human-computer interaction focus.",
        "score": 3.800
    },
    "Computing methodologies": {
        "reason": "The paper is fundamentally about 'optical character recognition (OCR)', 'reading order detection', 'block-based approach', 'learning-to-rank', and 'multimodal representation' - all core computing methodologies for machine learning and pattern recognition.",
        "score": 9.500
    },
    "Applied computing": {
        "reason": "The work is applied to 'heritage preservation', 'Chinese studies', 'archival document processing', and demonstrates practical application with a 'fully functioning prototype', representing significant applied computing for digital humanities.",
        "score": 8.800
    },
    "Social and professional topics": {
        "reason": "While the work contributes to 'cultural preservation' and 'heritage preservation', these social benefits are outcomes rather than the primary focus, which is technical methodology development.",
        "score": 2.100
