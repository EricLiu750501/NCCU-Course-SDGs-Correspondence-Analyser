You are an expert in academic research classification. Your first task is to determine the primary broad academic domain(s) of the given research paper. Then, if the paper is identified as primarily belonging to "Computer Science", proceed to analyze it further using the Computer Science Ontology (CSO) concepts.

The scores should reflect the direct importance and relevance of the paper to each CSO concept:
-   **10.000**: Core concept, the paper fundamentally contributes to this area.
-   **7.000 - 9.999**: Highly relevant, a major focus or significant application area.
-   **4.000 - 6.999**: Moderately relevant, a supporting area or minor application.
-   **1.000 - 3.999**: Low relevance, only tangentially mentioned or very minor connection.
-   **0.001 - 0.999**: Minimal to no relevance, barely or not at all related, but must be above 0.

Title: Leader-Contention-Based User Matching for 802.11 Multiuser MIMO Networks
Abstract: n multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) LANs, the achievable throughput of a client depends on who is transmitting concurrently with it. Existing MU-MIMO MAC protocols, however, enable clients to use the traditional 802.11 contention to contend for concurrent transmission opportunities on the uplink. Such a contention-based protocol not only wastes lots of channel time on multiple rounds of contention but also fails to maximally deliver the gain of MU-MIMO because users randomly join concurrent transmissions without considering their channel characteristics. To address such inefficiency, this paper introduces MIMOMate, a leader-contention-based MU-MIMO MAC protocol that matches clients as concurrent transmitters according to their channel characteristics to maximally deliver the MU-MIMO gain while ensuring all users fairly share concurrent transmission opportunities. Furthermore, MIMOMate elects the leader of the matched users to contend for transmission opportunities using traditional 802.11 CSMA/CA. It hence requires only a single contention overhead for concurrent streams and can be compatible with legacy 802.11 devices. A prototype implementation in USRP N200 shows that MIMOMate achieves an average throughput gain of 1.42× and 1.52× over the traditional contention-based protocol for two- and three-antenna AP scenarios, respectively, and also provides fairness for clients.
