    "General and reference": {
        "reason": "The paper focuses on a specific application of language models for e-commerce, which does not directly contribute to general reference materials or cross-cutting computing concepts. No terms like 'survey,' 'reference,' or 'general computing' appear in the title, abstract, or keywords.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Hardware": {
        "reason": "The paper does not mention hardware design, architecture, or performance. It focuses on software-based language models and clustering for e-commerce, with no reference to hardware components or systems.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computer systems organization": {
        "reason": "The paper describes a system (Use case-Based Shopping) but focuses on software implementation using language models and clustering, not on computer architecture, embedded systems, or organizational aspects of computing systems.",
        "score": 1.000
    },
    "Networks": {
        "reason": "The paper does not address network protocols, architectures, or connectivity. The mention of 'online experiment' refers to e-commerce platform usage, not network-specific concepts.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Software and its engineering": {
        "reason": "The paper proposes a software system (UBS) leveraging instruction-tuned language models (FLAN-T5, Claude 2) and clustering algorithms. Terms like 'instruction tuning,' 'multi-task training,' and 'software system design' indicate a strong focus on software engineering principles.",
        "score": 9.000
    },
    "Theory of computation": {
        "reason": "The paper does not explore theoretical aspects of computation, such as algorithms' complexity or formal models. While clustering is used, it is applied practically, not theoretically analyzed.",
        "score": 1.000
    },
    "Mathematics of computing": {
        "reason": "The paper employs clustering (hierarchical clustering compared to K-Means and LDA), which involves mathematical methods. However, the focus is on application rather than advancing mathematical theory or algorithms.",
        "score": 4.000
    },
    "Information systems": {
        "reason": "The paper directly contributes to information retrieval and recommender systems within e-commerce, as evidenced by 'Use case-Based Shopping,' 'product recommendations,' and 'mapping products to use cases,' aligning with information systems' focus on data organization and retrieval.",
        "score": 10.000
    },
    "Security and privacy": {
        "reason": "No mention of security, privacy, or related concepts like data protection or encryption appears in the title, abstract, or keywords. The focus is on e-commerce recommendations, not security mechanisms.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Human-centered computing": {
        "reason": "The paper emphasizes improving customer experience in e-commerce through use case-based recommendations, with terms like 'customer needs,' 'use cases,' and 'online experiment' indicating a focus on human-computer interaction in shopping contexts.",
        "score": 7.000
    },
    "Computing methodologies": {
        "reason": "The use of instruction-tuned language models (FLAN-T5, Claude 2) and clustering techniques directly relates to machine learning and natural language processing, core areas of computing methodologies. Keywords like 'instruction tuning' and 'clustering' support this relevance.",
        "score": 8.000
    },
    "Applied computing": {
        "reason": "The paper applies computing techniques (language models, clustering) to e-commerce, a practical domain, with demonstrated impact via 'revenue lift' and 'click rate lift' in online experiments, aligning with applied computing's focus on real-world applications.",
        "score": 7.000
    },
    "Social and professional topics": {
        "reason": "The paper's focus on e-commerce and customer needs tangentially relates to societal impacts of technology, but it does not explicitly address social or professional issues like ethics, policy, or workforce implications.",
        "score": 1.000
