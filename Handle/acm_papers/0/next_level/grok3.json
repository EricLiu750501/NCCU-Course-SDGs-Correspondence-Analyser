    "Data management systems": {
        "reason": "The paper involves managing and processing product review data for use case extraction and clustering, which relates to data organization and querying in e-commerce. However, it does not focus on core database management or system design, limiting its relevance.",
        "score": 4.000
    },
    "Information storage systems": {
        "reason": "The paper does not explicitly discuss storage systems or infrastructure for data persistence. Its focus is on processing and analyzing product review data, with no mention of storage mechanisms.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Information systems applications": {
        "reason": "The Use case-Based Shopping (UBS) system is a direct application in e-commerce, enhancing customer experiences through use case-driven product recommendations. Phrases like 'facilitates customer experiences' and 'online experiment' underscore its applied nature.",
        "score": 10.000
    },
    "World Wide Web": {
        "reason": "The paper operates in the context of e-commerce platforms, which are web-based systems. Terms like 'online experiment' and 'search, browse, and product pages' indicate a strong web application focus, though not on web protocols or infrastructure.",
        "score": 7.000
    },
    "Information retrieval": {
        "reason": "The UBS system involves extracting use case phrases from product reviews and mapping them to products, aligning with information retrieval tasks. 'Use case phrase extraction' and 'mapping products' directly relate to retrieving and organizing relevant information.",
        "score": 7.000
    },
    "Software organization and properties": {
        "reason": "The paper does not discuss software architecture, modularity, or properties like maintainability. Its focus is on algorithmic tasks and system application, with no mention of software organization principles.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Software notations and tools": {
        "reason": "While instruction-tuned LMs like FLAN-T5 and Claude 2 are used, the paper does not focus on developing or analyzing software tools or notations. These models are applied as components, not studied as tools themselves.",
        "score": 1.000
    },
    "Software creation and management": {
        "reason": "The paper does not address software development processes, lifecycle management, or methodologies. It focuses on applying existing models to a specific system, with no discussion of software creation practices.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Symbolic and algebraic manipulation": {
        "reason": "The paper has no connection to symbolic computation or algebraic methods. Its focus is on natural language processing and clustering for e-commerce, with no mention of symbolic techniques.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Parallel computing methodologies": {
        "reason": "There is no indication of parallel computing techniques in the paper. The methods described, such as clustering and LM inference, do not mention parallel processing or distributed computation.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Artificial intelligence": {
        "reason": "The use of instruction-tuned LMs (FLAN-T5, Claude 2) for use case extraction and clustering places the paper firmly in AI, specifically NLP. 'Instruction tuning' and 'task adaptation' highlight AI-driven contributions.",
        "score": 10.000
    },
    "Machine learning": {
        "reason": "The paper leverages machine learning through instruction-tuned LMs, multi-task training, and few-shot learning for UCSE. Keywords like 'instruction-tuned FLAN-T5' and 'multi-task training' indicate a core ML focus.",
        "score": 10.000
    },
    "Modeling and simulation": {
        "reason": "The paper does not involve modeling or simulation in the computational sense. Its focus is on data processing and recommendation systems, with no mention of simulation techniques.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computer graphics": {
        "reason": "The paper has no relation to computer graphics. It deals with text processing and e-commerce recommendations, with no mention of visualization or graphics techniques beyond a reference to 'Fig. 1'.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Distributed computing methodologies": {
        "reason": "There is no discussion of distributed computing or systems in the paper. The methods focus on single-model inference and clustering, with no indication of distributed algorithms or frameworks.",
        "score": 0.001
