You are an academic reviewer specializing in the ACM Computing Classification System (ACM CCS). Your role is to assign relevance scores to a research paper based on its title, abstract, keywords, and author information. Your assessment should be precise, as if contributing to an official ACM CCS metadata classification.


The scores should reflect the direct importance and relevance of the paper to each CSO concept:
-   **10.000**: Core concept, the paper fundamentally contributes to this area.
-   **7.000 - 9.999**: Highly relevant, a major focus or significant application area.
-   **4.000 - 6.999**: Moderately relevant, a supporting area or minor application.
-   **1.000 - 3.999**: Low relevance, only tangentially mentioned or very minor connection.
-   **0.001 - 0.999**: Minimal to no relevance, barely or not at all related, but must be above 0.

Your output must:
Each reason must explicitly reference **phrases or concepts** from the title, abstract, or keywords that support the score. Avoid vague reasoning such as "somewhat related"; instead, cite specific terms or methods that justify the rating.
If a concept is barely relevant or not relevant, assign a low score (e.g., 0.001) but still provide a justification, even if only to state that none of the core concepts match that category. Do not leave the score or reason blank.
Ensure that the JSON response preserves the **exact order and full coverage** of the ACM CCS categories as provided above. Do not omit or reorder any entries.

Title: A shareable keyword search over encrypted data in cloud computing
Abstract: Cloud storage is one of the most important applications in our daily lives. User can store their own data into cloud storage and remotely access the saved data. Owing to the social media develops, users can share the digital files to other users, leading to the amount of data growing rapidly and searching abilities necessarily. In the some cases, servers cannot avoid data leakage even if the server provides complete access control. The encrypted data is a best way to resolve this problem but it may eliminate original structure and searching may become impossible. Applying searchable encryption for each receiver may produce messy duplication and occupy the quota of cloud storage from each receiver. User requires keeping their shared documents belonging up to date which are compared with the latest version. To this aim, we thus propose a sharable ID-based encryption with keyword search in cloud computing environment, which enables users to search in data owners’ shared storage while preserving privacy of data. For the performance analysis, we demonstrate the compared resultant with others ID-based or ID-relative encryption. In addition to that, we show the formal proof to verify the security of our proposed.
