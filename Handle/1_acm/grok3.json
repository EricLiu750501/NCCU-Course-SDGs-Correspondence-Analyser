    "General and reference": {
        "reason": "The paper does not focus on general computing concepts or reference materials but is specific to data management in virtual environments. No phrases in the title, abstract, or keywords indicate contributions to this area.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Hardware": {
        "reason": "The paper mentions 'computing resources on the client side' but does not discuss hardware design or architecture. The focus is on software-based data management, with no direct hardware relevance.",
        "score": 1.000
    },
    "Computer systems organization": {
        "reason": "The paper discusses a 'client-server architecture' for managing virtual environments, which directly relates to system organization. The proposed data management scheme impacts system-level resource allocation.",
        "score": 7.000
    },
    "Networks": {
        "reason": "The 'client-server architecture' implies network involvement for data transmission, and 'reducing the amount of transmitted geometry data' suggests network optimization. However, networking is not the primary focus.",

    },
    "Software and its engineering": {
        "reason": "The paper proposes a 'data management scheme' including 'real-time scene management,' 'prioritized most likelihood movement model,' and 'hybrid coherence cache model,' all of which are software techniques for virtual environments.",
        "score": 10.000
    },
    "Theory of computation": {
        "reason": "The paper does not address theoretical aspects of computation such as algorithms or formal models. It focuses on applied data management techniques, with no mention of theoretical concepts.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Mathematics of computing": {
        "reason": "While the 'prioritized most likelihood movement model' may involve probabilistic modeling, the paper does not explicitly discuss mathematical techniques or focus on mathematical computing.",
        "score": 2.000
    },
    "Information systems": {
        "reason": "The paper's focus on 'spatial data management,' 'prefetching,' and 'caching' directly contributes to data management within information systems, particularly for virtual environments.",
        "score": 9.000

    "Security and privacy": {
        "reason": "The paper does not mention security or privacy concerns, focusing entirely on data management and performance optimization for virtual environments.",

    },
    "Human-centered computing": {
        "reason": "The paper aims to improve the 'quality of a walkthrough experience' in virtual environments, which relates to user interaction and visualization, key aspects of human-centered computing.",
        "score": 7.000
    },
    "Computing methodologies": {
        "reason": "Techniques like 'real-time scene management' and 'prioritized most likelihood movement model' involve computational methods for managing virtual environments, aligning with this category.",
        "score": 8.000
    },
    "Applied computing": {
        "reason": "The paper applies data management techniques to 'large-scale virtual environments,' a specific application domain, but the focus is more on the techniques than the application itself.",
        "score": 6.000

    "Social and professional topics": {
        "reason": "The paper does not address social or professional issues in computing, focusing solely on technical data management for virtual environments.",
