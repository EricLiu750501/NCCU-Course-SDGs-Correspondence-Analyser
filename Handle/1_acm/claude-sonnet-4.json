   "General and reference": {
       "reason": "The paper focuses on specific technical solutions for virtual environment data management rather than general reference material or broad computing concepts. No general reference aspects are evident in the title, abstract, or keywords.",
       "score": 0.001
   },
   "Hardware": {
       "reason": "While the paper mentions 'client-server architecture' and 'computing resources on the client side', the focus is on software-based data management schemes rather than hardware design, performance, or optimization. Hardware is only contextually referenced.",
       "score": 1.500
   },
   "Computer systems organization": {
       "reason": "The paper explicitly addresses 'client-server architecture' and discusses 'computing resources on the client side', which are core system organization concepts. The data management scheme involves distributed system considerations between client and server components.",
       "score": 7.200
   },
   "Networks": {
       "reason": "The paper addresses 'client-server architecture' and focuses on 'reducing the amount of transmitted geometry data', which directly involves network communication and data transmission optimization between distributed components.",
       "score": 6.800
   },
   "Software and its engineering": {
       "reason": "The core contribution is a 'data management scheme' involving 'real-time scene management', 'prefetching', and 'caching' algorithms. These are fundamental software engineering solutions for system performance optimization.",
       "score": 8.500
   },
   "Theory of computation": {
       "reason": "The paper proposes a 'prioritized most likelihood movement model' and 'hybrid coherence cache model', which involve algorithmic and theoretical approaches to prediction and caching, but the focus is more on practical implementation than theoretical analysis.",
       "score": 4.200
   },
   "Mathematics of computing": {
       "reason": "The 'most likelihood movement model' suggests some probabilistic or statistical modeling, and spatial data management involves geometric computations, but mathematical methods are not the primary focus of the contribution.",
       "score": 3.800
   },
   "Information systems": {
       "reason": "The paper directly addresses 'spatial data management' and 'large-scale virtual environment' data handling, which are core information systems concepts. The prefetching and caching mechanisms are fundamental data management techniques.",
       "score": 8.200
   },
   "Security and privacy": {
       "reason": "No mention of security, privacy, authentication, or related concerns in the title, abstract, or keywords. The focus is entirely on performance and data management efficiency.",
       "score": 0.001
   },
   "Human-centered computing": {
       "reason": "The paper focuses on improving 'walkthrough experience' and 'user's current motion intention', which directly relate to user experience and human-computer interaction in virtual environments. The quality of user experience is a primary concern.",
       "score": 7.500
   },
   "Computing methodologies": {
       "reason": "The paper is fundamentally about 'virtual environments', 'animation simulation' (from author expertise), and 'walkthrough' experiences, which are core computing methodologies for graphics, simulation, and virtual reality applications.",
       "score": 9.200
   },
   "Applied computing": {
       "reason": "Virtual environment applications span various domains, and the author's expertise includes 'sports planning' and 'robot automation', suggesting applied computing contexts, but the paper focuses more on the underlying technical methodology than specific application domains.",
       "score": 4.500
   },
   "Social and professional topics": {
       "reason": "No discussion of social implications, professional practices, ethics, or societal impacts. The paper is purely technical, focusing on system performance and data management solutions.",
