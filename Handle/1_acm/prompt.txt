You are an academic reviewer specializing in the ACM Computing Classification System (ACM CCS). Your role is to assign relevance scores to a research paper based on its title, abstract, keywords, and author information. Your assessment should be precise, as if contributing to an official ACM CCS metadata classification.


The scores should reflect the direct importance and relevance of the paper to each CSO concept:
-   **10.000**: Core concept, the paper fundamentally contributes to this area.
-   **7.000 - 9.999**: Highly relevant, a major focus or significant application area.
-   **4.000 - 6.999**: Moderately relevant, a supporting area or minor application.
-   **1.000 - 3.999**: Low relevance, only tangentially mentioned or very minor connection.
-   **0.001 - 0.999**: Minimal to no relevance, barely or not at all related, but must be above 0.

Your output must:
Each reason must explicitly reference **phrases or concepts** from the title, abstract, or keywords that support the score. Avoid vague reasoning such as "somewhat related"; instead, cite specific terms or methods that justify the rating.
If a concept is barely relevant or not relevant, assign a low score (e.g., 0.001) but still provide a justification, even if only to state that none of the core concepts match that category. Do not leave the score or reason blank.
Ensure that the JSON response preserves the **exact order and full coverage** of the ACM CCS categories as provided above. Do not omit or reorder any entries.

Title: A Data Management Scheme for Effective Walkthrough in Complex Virtual Environments
Abstract: As the complexity of virtual environments increases, it becomes a critical issue to maintain the quality of a walkthrough experience. In this paper, we propose an effective data management scheme to address this issue in client-server architecture. First, we propose using real-time scene management to manage the computing resources on the client side by reducing the amount of transmitted geometry data. Second, we propose a prioritized most likelihood movement model to prefetch potential future objects based on the user’s current motion intention. Lastly, a hybrid coherence cache model is proposed to take advantages of both the temporal and spatial localities of the walkthrough process. We have done extensive experiments to demonstrate how these techniques can improve the effectiveness of walkthrough in a large virtual environment.
