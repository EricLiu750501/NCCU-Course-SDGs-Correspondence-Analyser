    "General and reference": {
        "reason": "The paper mentions 'heritage preservation' and 'cultural preservation' which relate to general documentation and archival purposes, but these are not the core technical contributions of the work.",
        "score": 2.500
    },
    "Hardware": {
        "reason": "No hardware-specific concepts, components, or implementations are mentioned in the title, abstract, or keywords. The work focuses on algorithmic approaches rather than hardware solutions.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computer systems organization": {
        "reason": "While the paper involves 'document layout analysis' and processing systems, it does not address computer systems architecture, distributed systems, or organizational aspects of computing systems.",
        "score": 1.200
    },
    "Networks": {
        "reason": "No networking concepts, protocols, or distributed processing are mentioned. The work focuses on local document processing rather than networked systems.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Software and its engineering": {
        "reason": "The paper describes implementing 'a fully functioning prototype' and software methodologies for OCR systems, indicating moderate relevance to software engineering practices and implementation.",
        "score": 4.800
    },
    "Theory of computation": {
        "reason": "The work employs 'learning-to-rank' algorithms and 'pairwise sorting' methods, which involve computational theory concepts, though these are applied rather than theoretical contributions.",
        "score": 5.500
    },
    "Mathematics of computing": {
        "reason": "The approach uses 'learning-to-rank' and 'pairwise sorting' which involve mathematical optimization and ranking algorithms, plus evaluation metrics like 'position error rate (PER)'.",
        "score": 6.200
    },
    "Information systems": {
        "reason": "Core focus on 'optical character recognition (OCR)', 'document layout analysis', 'archival document processing', and converting 'hard-copy forms to digitized documents' - all central information system concepts.",
        "score": 9.200
    },
    "Security and privacy": {
        "reason": "No security, privacy, or cryptographic concepts are mentioned in the paper's title, abstract, or keywords.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Human-centered computing": {
        "reason": "The work aims to 'reduce the cost of post-OCR human labor for correction' and involves human interaction with document processing systems, showing moderate relevance to human-computer interaction.",
        "score": 4.300
    },
    "Computing methodologies": {
        "reason": "Highly relevant as the paper focuses on 'multimodal representation', machine learning approaches ('learning-to-rank'), and 'block-based models' - core computing methodology concepts.",
        "score": 8.700
    },
    "Applied computing": {
        "reason": "Strong relevance to 'heritage preservation', 'cultural preservation', and practical applications in 'Chinese studies' and extending to 'Japanese texts', representing significant applied computing work.",
        "score": 8.100
    },
    "Social and professional topics": {
        "reason": "The work addresses 'heritage preservation' and 'cultural preservation' which have social implications, but these aspects are secondary to the technical contributions.",
