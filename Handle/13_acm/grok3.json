{
    "General and reference": {
        "reason": "The paper discusses 'cultural preservation' and 'lasting storage' of digitized documents, which aligns with general computing goals of preserving and accessing information, but these are not the core focus of the research.",
        "score": 4.000
    },
    "Hardware": {
        "reason": "No mention of hardware-specific concepts, as the paper focuses on software-based OCR and reading order detection without reference to hardware implementation or optimization.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computer systems organization": {
        "reason": "The paper does not address computer systems organization, as it focuses on algorithmic and software-based approaches for OCR and reading order detection without discussing system architecture or organization.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Networks": {
        "reason": "No network-related concepts are mentioned, as the paper focuses on document processing and reading order detection, which are unrelated to network systems or protocols.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Software and its engineering": {
        "reason": "The paper describes a 'block-based approach' for reading order detection and mentions a 'fully functioning prototype,' indicating significant software development and engineering efforts.",
        "score": 7.000
    },
    "Theory of computation": {
        "reason": "The use of 'learning-to-rank' and comparison with 'n-gram models' and 'heuristic methods' suggests some theoretical contributions to algorithmic design, but the primary focus is on applied implementation.",
        "score": 4.000
    },
    "Mathematics of computing": {
        "reason": "The paper involves computational techniques like 'learning-to-rank' and evaluation metrics such as 'position error rate (PER),' indicating moderate use of mathematical methods in computing.",
        "score": 4.000
    },
    "Information systems": {
        "reason": "The paper directly contributes to information systems through 'document layout analysis' and 'archival document processing,' which are core components of information retrieval and management systems.",
        "score": 10.000
    },
    "Security and privacy": {
        "reason": "No security or privacy concepts are mentioned, as the paper focuses on OCR and reading order detection without addressing data protection or secure processing.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Human-centered computing": {
        "reason": "The paper mentions reducing 'post-OCR human labor for correction,' indicating a focus on improving human interaction with document processing systems, though this is a secondary aspect.",
        "score": 4.000
    },
    "Computing methodologies": {
        "reason": "The paper's core contribution involves 'learning-to-rank,' 'multimodal representation,' and 'block-based models,' which are advanced computational methodologies for reading order detection.",
        "score": 10.000
    },
    "Applied computing": {
        "reason": "The application to 'classical Chinese documents' and 'heritage preservation,' along with the prototype demonstration at AAAI, directly ties to applied computing in cultural and archival contexts.",
        "score": 7.000
    },
    "Social and professional topics": {
        "reason": "The paper's focus on 'cultural preservation' and its potential extensibility to 'Japanese texts' touches on societal impacts of computing, but this is not a primary focus.",
