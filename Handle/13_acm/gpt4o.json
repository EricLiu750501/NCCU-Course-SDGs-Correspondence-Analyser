    "General and reference": {
        "reason": "The paper discusses the importance of OCR in 'heritage preservation' and presents a working prototype, aligning with metadata and documentation concerns in the 'General and reference' category.",
        "score": 4.500
    },
    "Hardware": {
        "reason": "The paper does not mention or imply any interaction with hardware components or systems. All methods are software-based.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computer systems organization": {
        "reason": "There is no discussion of system-level design, distributed architectures, or hardware-software interfaces, which are the focus of this category.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Networks": {
        "reason": "No networking or communication systems are involved or discussed in the context of OCR or reading order detection.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Software and its engineering": {
        "reason": "The development and evaluation of a 'fully functioning prototype' and discussion of model performance tie closely to software design and engineering, particularly in layout-aware text processing.",
        "score": 6.800
    },
    "Theory of computation": {
        "reason": "The paper does not engage with theoretical models, formal languages, or complexity classes. Although learning-to-rank has theoretical underpinnings, its use here is practical.",
        "score": 1.200
    },
    "Mathematics of computing": {
        "reason": "Mentions of 'learning-to-rank' and 'position error rate' show limited engagement with algorithmic evaluation and statistical metrics, warranting a minor relevance score.",
        "score": 2.000
    },
    "Information systems": {
        "reason": "The paper's focus on 'digitized documents', 'document layout analysis', and 'archival document processing' aligns well with document representation, indexing, and digital libraries.",
        "score": 8.500
    },
    "Security and privacy": {
        "reason": "The paper does not address any aspect of security, data protection, or user privacy.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Human-centered computing": {
        "reason": "While the end-goal of reducing human labor is mentioned, the focus is on algorithmic layout analysis, not human-computer interaction or UX/UI.",
        "score": 2.800
    },
    "Computing methodologies": {
        "reason": "Central to the paper are methods such as 'block-based models', 'learning-to-rank', and evaluation on a benchmark dataset, making this a core area of contribution.",
        "score": 10.000
    },
    "Applied computing": {
        "reason": "The paper is rooted in the application of OCR and reading order detection to 'heritage preservation' and 'archival document processing', representing a high degree of applied relevance.",
        "score": 9.200
    },
    "Social and professional topics": {
        "reason": "Although cultural preservation is discussed, the paper does not address ethical, legal, or professional issues in computing directly.",
