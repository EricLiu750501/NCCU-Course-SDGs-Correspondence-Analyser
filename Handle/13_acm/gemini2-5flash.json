  "General and reference": {
    "reason": "The paper discusses 'cultural preservation' and 'heritage preservation' through 'OCR' for 'classical Chinese documents', which broadly relates to archiving and reference materials. While not a primary focus, the application is within this domain.",
    "score": 4.500
  },
  "Hardware": {
    "reason": "There is no mention of hardware components, design, or performance in the title, abstract, or keywords. The focus is entirely on software and algorithmic aspects of OCR.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "Computer systems organization": {
    "reason": "The paper does not discuss computer architecture, operating systems, or distributed computing. Its focus is on a specific application's algorithmic and methodological aspects, not the underlying system organization.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "Networks": {
    "reason": "The paper makes no mention of networks, communication protocols, or distributed systems. The research is self-contained within the processing of digital documents.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "Software and its engineering": {
    "reason": "The paper describes the 'implementation' and 'demonstration' of a 'fully functioning prototype' for 'reading order detection' using a 'block-based approach', indicating a strong focus on software development and engineering principles for a specific task.",
    "score": 7.500
  },
  "Theory of computation": {
    "reason": "While the paper presents an algorithm and evaluates its performance ('reducing the position error rate', 'impressive results'), it does not delve into the theoretical foundations of computation, complexity theory, or formal methods. The 'learning-to-rank' idea is applied, not theoretically explored.",
    "score": 2.000
  },
  "Mathematics of computing": {
    "reason": "The paper uses quantitative metrics like 'position error rate (PER)' and discusses 'experimental results' and 'statistical significance' (e.g., 'significant improvement'). However, it doesn't primarily contribute to mathematical theories or models used in computing, but rather applies computational methods.",
    "score": 4.000
  },
  "Information systems": {
    "reason": "The paper focuses on 'digitized documents' and 'lasting storage and further analysis' of 'information in their hard-copy forms', which are direct applications within information retrieval and management systems. 'Archival document processing' is also a key aspect.",
    "score": 8.000
  },
  "Security and privacy": {
    "reason": "There is no mention of security concerns, data privacy, encryption, or access control in the context of the OCR or document processing methods discussed.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "Human-centered computing": {
    "reason": "The paper aims to 'reduces the cost of post-OCR human labor for correction', directly impacting user efficiency and experience with digitized documents. The concept of 'reading order detection' is inherently human-centric in how we interpret documents.",
    "score": 6.500
  },
  "Computing methodologies": {
    "reason": "The core of the paper is the development of a 'block-based approach' for 'reading order detection' and 'document layout analysis', which involves specific 'algorithms' and 'methodologies' in areas like 'optical character recognition' and 'learning-to-rank'. 'Multimodal representation' is also a key methodology.",
    "score": 10.000
  },
  "Applied computing": {
    "reason": "The paper presents a direct application of computing techniques to a specific problem: 'OCR for classical Chinese documents' and 'heritage preservation'. It provides 'demonstrations' and evaluates 'actual performance of the prototype', showing practical utility.",
    "score": 9.500
  },
  "Social and professional topics": {
    "reason": "The paper broadly relates to 'cultural preservation' and 'heritage preservation', which have societal implications. However, it does not directly discuss ethical considerations, legal aspects, or professional practices within computing, beyond the application itself.",
    "score": 3.000
