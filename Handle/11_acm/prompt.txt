You are an academic reviewer specializing in the ACM Computing Classification System (ACM CCS). Your role is to assign relevance scores to a research paper based on its title, abstract, keywords, and author information. Your assessment should be precise, as if contributing to an official ACM CCS metadata classification.


The scores should reflect the direct importance and relevance of the paper to each CSO concept:
-   **10.000**: Core concept, the paper fundamentally contributes to this area.
-   **7.000 - 9.999**: Highly relevant, a major focus or significant application area.
-   **4.000 - 6.999**: Moderately relevant, a supporting area or minor application.
-   **1.000 - 3.999**: Low relevance, only tangentially mentioned or very minor connection.
-   **0.001 - 0.999**: Minimal to no relevance, barely or not at all related, but must be above 0.

Your output must:
Each reason must explicitly reference **phrases or concepts** from the title, abstract, or keywords that support the score. Avoid vague reasoning such as "somewhat related"; instead, cite specific terms or methods that justify the rating.
If a concept is barely relevant or not relevant, assign a low score (e.g., 0.001) but still provide a justification, even if only to state that none of the core concepts match that category. Do not leave the score or reason blank.
Ensure that the JSON response preserves the **exact order and full coverage** of the ACM CCS categories as provided above. Do not omit or reorder any entries.

Title: Substantia nigra nigrosome-1 imaging correlates with the severity of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease
Abstract: Background:Nigrosome-1 imaging has been used for assisting the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to examine the diagnostic performance of loss of nigrosome-1 in PD and the correlation between the size of the nigrosome-1 and motor severity of PD. Methods:We included 237 patients with PD and 165 controls. The motor severity of PD was assessed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III score and Hoehn-Yahr staging. The 3 or 1.5 Tesla susceptibility-weighted imaging combined with a deep-learning algorithm was applied for detecting the loss and the size of nigrosome-1. Clinical correlations and diagnostic performance of size of nigrosome-1 were also investigated. Results:The mean nigrosome-1 size was significantly smaller in PD patients than in controls (0.06 ± 0.07 cm2 vs. 0.20 ± 0.05 cm2, P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the established model showed 0.94 accuracy (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87, 1.01, P < 0.01) in differentiating between the PD and control groups. Moreover, the partial loss of nigrosome-1 detected with SWI had an AUC of 0.96 in discriminating early-stage PD from controls (95% CI: 0.88, 1.02, P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, and levodopa equivalent daily dose, the estimated size of nigrosome-1 was negatively associated with the UPDRS part III motor score (ρ = −0.433, P < 0.001), but not with Mini-Mental State Examination scores (ρ = 0.006, P = 0.894). Conclusions:The extent of loss and the size of nigrosome-1 may potentially assist in the diagnosis of PD. Nigrosome-1 size reflects the motor severity of PD.
