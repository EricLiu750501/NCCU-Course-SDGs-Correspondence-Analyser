    "General and reference": {
        "reason": "The paper lacks general computing reference material, tutorials, or surveys. It is a specialized medical imaging study with no broad computing education or reference value.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Hardware": {
        "reason": "The paper mentions '3 or 1.5 Tesla susceptibility-weighted imaging' equipment but focuses on software analysis rather than hardware design, development, or optimization of MRI systems.",
        "score": 1.500
    },
    "Computer systems organization": {
        "reason": "No discussion of computer architectures, distributed systems, or system organization. The paper focuses on medical image analysis applications rather than underlying system design.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Networks": {
        "reason": "No mention of networking, communication protocols, or distributed computing. The study appears to use standalone imaging analysis without network components.",

    },
    "Software and its engineering": {
        "reason": "The 'deep-learning algorithm' mentioned suggests custom software development for medical image analysis, but software engineering practices, methodologies, or system design are not the focus.",
        "score": 3.200
    },
    "Theory of computation": {
        "reason": "No theoretical computer science concepts, algorithms analysis, or computational complexity discussed. The deep learning application is practical rather than theoretical.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Mathematics of computing": {
        "reason": "Statistical analysis methods like 'receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)', correlation coefficients (ρ = −0.433), and confidence intervals indicate mathematical computing applications in medical data analysis.",
        "score": 4.800
    },
    "Information systems": {
        "reason": "Author expertise in '醫療資訊' (medical informatics) and '資料探勘' (data mining) directly relates to medical information systems and health data management applications.",

    },
    "Human-centered computing": {
        "reason": "The diagnostic application assists clinicians in Parkinson's disease assessment, representing a human-centered medical computing application, though user interface design is not discussed.",
