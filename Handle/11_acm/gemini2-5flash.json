  "General and reference": {
    "reason": "This category is for survey papers, reference works, or general topics. The paper is a specific research study on Parkinson's disease imaging, not a general reference or survey.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "Hardware": {
    "reason": "The paper mentions '3 or 1.5 Tesla susceptibility-weighted imaging' which refers to specific MRI hardware, but the focus of the paper is on the diagnostic application and analysis of the imaging data, not the design, development, or optimization of the hardware itself.",
    "score": 2.500
  },
  "Computer systems organization": {
    "reason": "This category deals with the architecture and organization of computer systems. The paper does not discuss computer system architecture, distributed computing, or embedded systems.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "Networks": {
    "reason": "This category covers computer networks and communication. The paper does not involve network protocols, network security, or distributed network systems.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "Software and its engineering": {
    "reason": "The paper mentions a 'deep-learning algorithm was applied for detecting the loss and the size of nigrosome-1'. While this implies software development, the paper's primary focus is on the clinical application of this algorithm and the diagnostic findings, not the software engineering process, design, or maintenance of the algorithm itself.",
    "score": 4.000
  },
  "Theory of computation": {
    "reason": "This category concerns theoretical aspects of computing, such as algorithms, complexity, and logic. The paper applies a deep-learning algorithm but does not contribute to the theoretical foundations of computation or algorithm design.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "Mathematics of computing": {
    "reason": "The paper utilizes statistical analysis ('P < 0.001', 'AUC', '95% confidence interval', 'ρ = −0.433') to evaluate diagnostic performance and correlations. This involves mathematical and statistical methods applied within a computational context.",
    "score": 5.000
  },
  "Information systems": {
    "reason": "The paper deals with 'medical informatics' (from author expertise) and uses a 'deep-learning algorithm' for 'assisting the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease'. This falls under information systems that process and analyze data for specific applications, particularly in a healthcare context.",
    "score": 7.500
  },
  "Security and privacy": {
    "reason": "This category focuses on protecting computer systems and data. The paper does not address security or privacy issues related to patient data or medical systems.",
    "score": 0.001
  },
  "Human-centered computing": {
    "reason": "While the research is for human health (Parkinson's disease patients), the paper's core focus is on diagnostic imaging and algorithmic analysis, not on human-computer interaction, usability, or accessibility.",
    "score": 1.000
  },
  "Computing methodologies": {
    "reason": "The paper explicitly states that a 'deep-learning algorithm was applied' for image analysis and detection. This is a core 'computing methodology' used in the research, aligning with areas like artificial intelligence and machine learning, which are fundamental to this category. The author's expertise includes '機器學習' (machine learning).",
    "score": 9.500
  },
  "Applied computing": {
    "reason": "The paper's entire premise is the 'application' of nigrosome-1 imaging and deep-learning algorithms for the 'diagnosis of Parkinson's disease' and assessing 'motor severity of PD'. This is a direct application of computational techniques to a real-world problem in 'medical informatics' (from author expertise), making it highly relevant to applied computing.",
    "score": 10.000

  "Social and professional topics": {
    "reason": "This category covers societal impacts, ethical considerations, and professional issues in computing. The paper is a technical medical imaging study and does not discuss social or professional implications of its findings.",
