You are an academic reviewer specializing in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Your role is to assign **relevance scores** to a research paper based on its **title, abstract, keywords, and author information**.
Your assessment should be precise, as if contributing to an official SDG metadata classification.

The scores should reflect the direct importance and relevance of the paper to each SDG target:
- **10.000**: Core contribution, the paper fundamentally addresses this SDG.
- **7.000 - 9.999**: Highly relevant, a major focus or significant application area.
- **4.000 - 6.999**: Moderately relevant, a supporting area or minor application.
- **1.000 - 3.999**: Low relevance, only tangentially mentioned or very minor connection.
- **0.001 - 0.999**: Minimal to no relevance, barely or not at all related, but must be above 0.

Title: Investigating the Influence of Data Architecture on the Performance of Kubernetes-based Applications
Abstract: Kubernetes has gained significant importance and popularity as a leading container orchestration platform, facilitating the deployment and management of distributed applications. However, despite its widespread adoption, the exploration of data architecture in the context of Kubernetes-based applications remains limited. The design and configuration of data architecture of a Kubernetes cluster can profoundly impact the overall performance and scalability of applications. This paper aims to investigate the influence of data architecture on the performance of Kubernetes-based applications. By analyzing various aspects of data architecture we aim to understand their impact on crucial performance metrics through a series of experiments and performance evaluations. Specifically, we examine different data architecture configurations and their effects on application performance. The outcomes of this research contribute to enhancing the understanding of the relationship between data architecture and the performance of Kubernetes-based applications, empowering developers and system administrators to make informed decisions when optimizing and designing data architecture for their applications in a Kubernetes environment.
