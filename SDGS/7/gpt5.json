    },
    "Decent Work and Economic Growth": {
        "reason": "Paper contributes to efficiency and productivity in cloud-native computing, which may indirectly support economic growth through digital innovation.",
        "score": 4.500
    },
    "Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure": {
        "reason": "Core relevance: the study advances understanding of cloud infrastructure, data architecture, and scalable application deployment in Kubernetes.",
        "score": 9.500
    },
    "Reduced Inequalities": {
        "reason": "No explicit mention of inequality or inclusive access to technology; focus remains on technical performance evaluation.",
        "score": 0.200
    },
    "Sustainable Cities and Communities": {
        "reason": "Indirect connection, as cloud-native systems can support smart environments and IoT, but not directly addressed in this paper.",
        "score": 2.500
    },
    "Responsible Consumption and Production": {
        "reason": "Optimizing data architecture may reduce computational resource waste, but sustainability in production/consumption is not a focus.",
        "score": 1.800
    },
    "Climate Action": {
        "reason": "No mention of climate change or environmental mitigation; performance focus only marginally relates to energy/resource efficiency.",
