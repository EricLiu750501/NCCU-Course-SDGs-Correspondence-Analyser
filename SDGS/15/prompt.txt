You are an academic reviewer specializing in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Your role is to assign **relevance scores** to a research paper based on its **title, abstract, keywords, and author information**.
Your assessment should be precise, as if contributing to an official SDG metadata classification.

The scores should reflect the direct importance and relevance of the paper to each SDG target:
- **10.000**: Core contribution, the paper fundamentally addresses this SDG.
- **7.000 - 9.999**: Highly relevant, a major focus or significant application area.
- **4.000 - 6.999**: Moderately relevant, a supporting area or minor application.
- **1.000 - 3.999**: Low relevance, only tangentially mentioned or very minor connection.
- **0.001 - 0.999**: Minimal to no relevance, barely or not at all related, but must be above 0.

Title: Algorithms for Discovery of Spatial Co-orientation Patterns from Images
Abstract: Image mining is an important task to discover interesting and meaningful patterns form large image databases. In this paper, we introduce the spatial co-orientation patterns in image databases. Spatial co-orientation patterns refer to objects that frequently occur with the same spatial orientation, e.g. left, right, below, etc. among images. For example, an object P is frequently left to an object Q among images. We utilize the data structure, 2D string, to represent the spatial orientation of objects in an image. Two approaches, Apriori-based and pattern-growth approaches, are proposed for mining co-orientation patterns. An experimental evaluation with synthetic datasets shows the advantage and disadvantage between these two algorithms
