    "No Poverty": {
        "reason": "The paper focuses on theoretical cryptography and information security ('subset predicate encryption', 'quantum-resistance'), with no direct or indirect connection to poverty alleviation strategies or economic inclusion for the poor.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Zero Hunger": {
        "reason": "The research on encryption and access control does not address food security, sustainable agriculture, or nutrition. The concepts are entirely unrelated.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Good Health and Well-being": {
        "reason": "The paper's concepts of 'fine-grained access control' and enhancing 'privacy for receivers' are moderately relevant to securing sensitive electronic health records and patient data, which is a component of modern health infrastructure.",
        "score": 4.200
    },
    "Quality Education": {
        "reason": "While data security is relevant to educational institutions, the paper's advanced, quantum-resistant encryption methods are not a primary focus for the education sector. The connection is tangential.",
        "score": 1.100
    },
    "Gender Equality": {
        "reason": "The paper does not address gender equality. While secure communications can protect vulnerable groups, this is a generic application of security, not a focus of the research itself.",

    },
    "Clean Water and Sanitation": {
        "reason": "The research on attribute-hiding encryption has no discernible application or connection to water management, sanitation systems, or hygiene.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Affordable and Clean Energy": {
        "reason": "The paper's focus is on data security and cryptography. There is no mention or logical link to energy generation, efficiency, or access.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Decent Work and Economic Growth": {
        "reason": "The paper contributes to the underlying security of digital infrastructure, a low-relevance enabler for the digital economy. It does not directly address employment, economic policy, or working conditions.",
        "score": 2.800
    },
    "Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure": {
        "reason": "This paper is a core contribution to technological innovation. Developing 'quantum-resistance' is crucial for building resilient and future-proof digital infrastructure, which is a key target of this SDG.",
        "score": 8.900
    },
    "Reduced Inequalities": {
        "reason": "The research does not address social, economic, or political inequalities. The cryptographic methods presented are universal and not targeted at any specific marginalized group.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Sustainable Cities and Communities": {
        "reason": "The encryption technology could be a supporting component for securing data in smart city infrastructure, but this is a minor, unstated application. The relevance is low.",
        "score": 1.800
    },
    "Responsible Consumption and Production": {
        "reason": "The paper's subject matter of digital encryption is unrelated to sustainable consumption, resource management, or production patterns.",

    "Life on Land": {
        "reason": "The research on quantum-resistant encryption does not relate to terrestrial ecosystems, biodiversity, or land degradation.",
        "score": 0.001
    },
    "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions": {
        "reason": "The paper is highly relevant as it develops technologies for 'information security', 'access control', and 'privacy'. These are fundamental for building secure, trustworthy, and strong digital institutions and protecting fundamental freedoms online.",
