    },
    "Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure": {
        "reason": "The work contributes to digital infrastructure and innovation through 'quantum-resistant construction' and 'efficient decryption', directly advancing secure IT systems.",
        "score": 8.000
    },
    "Reduced Inequalities": {
        "reason": "Attribute-hiding encryption supports privacy and anonymity, potentially reducing digital inequalities in access control, but not explicitly the paper's aim.",
        "score": 2.500
    },
    "Sustainable Cities and Communities": {
        "reason": "Secure information infrastructures can indirectly benefit smart cities, but no mention is made of urban systems or communities.",
