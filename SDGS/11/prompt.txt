You are an academic reviewer specializing in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Your role is to assign **relevance scores** to a research paper based on its **title, abstract, keywords, and author information**.
Your assessment should be precise, as if contributing to an official SDG metadata classification.

The scores should reflect the direct importance and relevance of the paper to each SDG target:
- **10.000**: Core contribution, the paper fundamentally addresses this SDG.
- **7.000 - 9.999**: Highly relevant, a major focus or significant application area.
- **4.000 - 6.999**: Moderately relevant, a supporting area or minor application.
- **1.000 - 3.999**: Low relevance, only tangentially mentioned or very minor connection.
- **0.001 - 0.999**: Minimal to no relevance, barely or not at all related, but must be above 0.

Title: Substantia nigra nigrosome-1 imaging correlates with the severity of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease
Abstract: Background:Nigrosome-1 imaging has been used for assisting the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to examine the diagnostic performance of loss of nigrosome-1 in PD and the correlation between the size of the nigrosome-1 and motor severity of PD. Methods:We included 237 patients with PD and 165 controls. The motor severity of PD was assessed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III score and Hoehn-Yahr staging. The 3 or 1.5 Tesla susceptibility-weighted imaging combined with a deep-learning algorithm was applied for detecting the loss and the size of nigrosome-1. Clinical correlations and diagnostic performance of size of nigrosome-1 were also investigated. Results:The mean nigrosome-1 size was significantly smaller in PD patients than in controls (0.06 ± 0.07 cm2 vs. 0.20 ± 0.05 cm2, P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the established model showed 0.94 accuracy (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87, 1.01, P < 0.01) in differentiating between the PD and control groups. Moreover, the partial loss of nigrosome-1 detected with SWI had an AUC of 0.96 in discriminating early-stage PD from controls (95% CI: 0.88, 1.02, P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, and levodopa equivalent daily dose, the estimated size of nigrosome-1 was negatively associated with the UPDRS part III motor score (ρ = −0.433, P < 0.001), but not with Mini-Mental State Examination scores (ρ = 0.006, P = 0.894). Conclusions:The extent of loss and the size of nigrosome-1 may potentially assist in the diagnosis of PD. Nigrosome-1 size reflects the motor severity of PD.
