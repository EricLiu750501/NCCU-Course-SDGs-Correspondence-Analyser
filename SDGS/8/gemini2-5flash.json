    "score": 0.001
  },
  "Affordable and Clean Energy": {
    "reason": "While not a primary focus, optimizing the performance and 'data architecture' of Kubernetes clusters can lead to more efficient use of computational resources, indirectly contributing to reduced energy consumption in data centers.",
    "score": 2.500
  },
  "Decent Work and Economic Growth": {
    "reason": "The research supports the digital economy by improving the performance of 'Kubernetes-based applications,' a foundational technology for many modern businesses. This enhances productivity and fosters growth in the tech sector.",
    "score": 4.500
  },
  "Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure": {
    "reason": "The paper is a core contribution to this goal. It directly addresses improving digital infrastructure ('Kubernetes cluster', 'data architecture') and fosters innovation in 'cloud native systems,' which are crucial for modern industry.",
    "score": 9.500
  },
  "Reduced Inequalities": {
    "reason": "The paper does not discuss social, economic, or political inclusion and its technical scope does not engage with the topic of inequality.",
