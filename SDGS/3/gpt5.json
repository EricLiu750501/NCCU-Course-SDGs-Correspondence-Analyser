    "No Poverty": {
        "reason": "The paper focuses on data privacy and encrypted keyword search in cloud computing, with no connection to poverty reduction or socioeconomic inequality.",
        "score": 0.100
    },
    "Zero Hunger": {
        "reason": "No reference to agriculture, food security, nutrition, or hunger-related technologies; focus is solely on encryption and cloud data storage.",
        "score": 0.050
    },
    "Good Health and Well-being": {
        "reason": "While health data security can benefit indirectly from privacy-preserving cloud storage, the paper does not address healthcare or well-being directly.",
        "score": 1.500
    },
    "Quality Education": {
        "reason": "Educational institutions may use cloud computing and secure data sharing, but the paper does not directly discuss education, learning, or capacity building.",
        "score": 1.200
    },
    "Gender Equality": {
        "reason": "No mention of gender, inclusivity, or empowerment; purely technical cryptography contribution.",
        "score": 0.050
    },
    "Clean Water and Sanitation": {
        "reason": "No discussion of water, sanitation, or related infrastructure; unrelated to this SDG.",

    },
    "Affordable and Clean Energy": {
        "reason": "The paper does not address energy systems, renewable energy, or energy efficiency; focus is strictly on secure data storage and retrieval.",
        "score": 0.050
    },
    "Decent Work and Economic Growth": {
        "reason": "By improving secure cloud services, the research can indirectly support digital economy and IT-based work, but this is not a central theme.",
        "score": 2.000
    },
    "Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure": {
        "reason": "Core relevance: proposes an innovative cryptographic solution (shareable ID-based encryption with keyword search) for cloud computing infrastructure and secure data services.",
        "score": 9.000
    },
    "Reduced Inequalities": {
        "reason": "The solution may indirectly contribute to digital inclusion by enabling more secure data sharing, but inequality is not explicitly addressed.",
        "score": 1.500
    },
    "Sustainable Cities and Communities": {
        "reason": "Secure digital infrastructure supports smart cities indirectly, but the paper does not focus on urban sustainability or communities.",
        "score": 1.000
    },
    "Responsible Consumption and Production": {
        "reason": "The method reduces data duplication in cloud storage (preventing messy duplication and quota occupation), which relates modestly to efficient resource use.",
        "score": 2.500
    },
    "Climate Action": {
        "reason": "No connection to climate change mitigation, adaptation, or resilience.",

        "score": 0.050
    },
    "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions": {
        "reason": "Relevance is moderate: enhancing information security, privacy protection, and secure data access aligns with building trustworthy digital institutions.",
        "score": 5.500
    },
    "Partnerships for the Goals": {
        "reason": "Cloud security may facilitate international cooperation in research and data sharing, but partnerships are not explicitly discussed.",
