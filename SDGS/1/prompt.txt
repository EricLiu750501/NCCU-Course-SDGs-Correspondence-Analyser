You are an academic reviewer specializing in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Your role is to assign **relevance scores** to a research paper based on its **title, abstract, keywords, and author information**.
Your assessment should be precise, as if contributing to an official SDG metadata classification.

The scores should reflect the direct importance and relevance of the paper to each SDG target:
- **10.000**: Core contribution, the paper fundamentally addresses this SDG.
- **7.000 - 9.999**: Highly relevant, a major focus or significant application area.
- **4.000 - 6.999**: Moderately relevant, a supporting area or minor application.
- **1.000 - 3.999**: Low relevance, only tangentially mentioned or very minor connection.
- **0.001 - 0.999**: Minimal to no relevance, barely or not at all related, but must be above 0.

Title: A Data Management Scheme for Effective Walkthrough in Complex Virtual Environments
Abstract: As the complexity of virtual environments increases, it becomes a critical issue to maintain the quality of a walkthrough experience. In this paper, we propose an effective data management scheme to address this issue in client-server architecture. First, we propose using real-time scene management to manage the computing resources on the client side by reducing the amount of transmitted geometry data. Second, we propose a prioritized most likelihood movement model to prefetch potential future objects based on the user’s current motion intention. Lastly, a hybrid coherence cache model is proposed to take advantages of both the temporal and spatial localities of the walkthrough process. We have done extensive experiments to demonstrate how these techniques can improve the effectiveness of walkthrough in a large virtual environment.
