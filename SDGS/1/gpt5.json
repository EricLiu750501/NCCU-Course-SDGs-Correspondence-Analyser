    },
    "Good Health and Well-being": {
        "reason": "Virtual walkthroughs may have minor applications in health-related simulations or rehabilitation, but this is not the paper’s focus.",
        "score": 1.500
    },
    "Quality Education": {
        "reason": "The work could support educational uses of large virtual environments (e.g., immersive learning), but this application is only indirect.",

    },
    "Reduced Inequalities": {
        "reason": "No focus on reducing inequalities in access, participation, or opportunity; purely technical.",
        "score": 0.200
    },
    "Sustainable Cities and Communities": {
        "reason": "Virtual walkthroughs may contribute indirectly to urban planning or smart city simulations, though this is not explicitly addressed.",
        "score": 2.500
    },
    "Responsible Consumption and Production": {
        "reason": "The paper’s efficiency models reduce computational waste, but no direct link to sustainable consumption or production is made.",
