    },
    "Good Health and Well-being": {
        "reason": "Some human-computer interaction (HCI) technologies like wearable devices, brainwave interaction, and AI agents could support health applications, but health is not a core focus of the course.",

        "reason": "The course emphasizes advanced HCI technologies (VR, AR, robotics, embedded platforms), directly contributing to innovation and digital infrastructure development.",
        "score": 8.500
    },
    "Reduced Inequalities": {
        "reason": "While accessibility technologies are implied (e.g., gesture, speech, wearable interfaces), the course does not explicitly address reducing inequalities.",
        "score": 2.500
    },
    "Sustainable Cities and Communities": {
        "reason": "Some HCI technologies such as AR, VR, and robotics may contribute to urban solutions, but this is not the courseâ€™s central aim.",
        "score": 3.500
    },
    "Responsible Consumption and Production": {
        "reason": "No mention of sustainability in production or consumption; focus is on technology skills and education.",
