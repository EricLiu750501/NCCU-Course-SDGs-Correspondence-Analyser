    },
    "Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B is better. It provides a much more comprehensive list of explicit evidence, including 'urban planning and design', 'green infrastructure', 'smart technology', and 'Sustainable Transportation', all directly relevant to this SDG. Model A's evidence is less complete."
    },
    "Reduced Inequalities": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B is better. It explicitly includes 'Environmental and Social Justice' (a weekly topic) in addition to 'design of sharing to enhance equity and justice', providing stronger and more comprehensive evidence for a higher score of 8.5."
    },
    "Sustainable Cities and Communities": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B is better. The course title itself is 'Sustainable and Sharing Cities', making this a perfect and direct match. Model B's score of 10.0 is fully justified, while Model A's 9.5 is slightly understated."
    },
    "Responsible Consumption and Production": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B is better. In addition to 'collaborative consumption and production', Model B also identifies 'Ecological Footprint' as explicit evidence, which is a key concept related to responsible consumption, justifying its higher score of 7.0."
    },
    "Climate Action": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B is better. It provides more comprehensive explicit evidence, including 'Coping with Global Climate Change' and 'The Urban Heat Island Effect', alongside 'climate action planning', warranting a higher score of 9.0."
    },
    "Life Below Water": {
      "winner": "Tie",
      "justification": "Both models correctly identify no explicit evidence in the syllabus for Life Below Water."
    },
    "Life on Land": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B is better. It includes 'green infrastructure' alongside 'Urban Ecology and Green Networks' as evidence, providing a more complete picture of the course's relevance to terrestrial ecosystems within urban contexts, justifying its slightly higher score of 5.0."
    },
    "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B is better. It explicitly includes 'Environmental and Social Justice' and 'city governance' as evidence, which directly relates to 'Justice' and 'Strong Institutions', respectively, making its justification more comprehensive and accurate."
    },
    "Partnerships for the Goals": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B is better. It provides more direct evidence for partnerships through 'collaboration' and 'civic engagement', which are more explicit forms of partnership than just 'city governance' mentioned by Model A, justifying its higher score of 6.5."
