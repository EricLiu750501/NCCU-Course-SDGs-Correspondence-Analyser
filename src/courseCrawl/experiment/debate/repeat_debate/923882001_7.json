    "Life on Land": {
      "winner": "A",
      "justification": "Both models identify relevant evidence ('Urban Ecology and Green Networks', 'green infrastructure'). Model A's higher score of 6.5 is more appropriate for this explicit connection to terrestrial ecosystems in urban contexts."
    },
    "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions": {
      "winner": "A",
      "justification": "Both models provide strong explicit evidence. Model A's score of 8.0 is slightly more appropriate given the multiple explicit mentions of 'Environmental and Social Justice', 'equity and justice', and 'city governance'."
    },
    "Partnerships for the Goals": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B's inferred evidence ('collaboration', 'civic engagement', 'shared urban commons') feels more directly aligned with the spirit of partnerships and multi-stakeholder engagement than Model A's 'multi-city case studies' alone."
