    "Life Below Water": {
      "winner": "Tie",
      "justification": "Both models correctly identified no relevant evidence in the course syllabus for this SDG."
    },
    "Life on Land": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B makes a plausible inferred connection that '土地重劃' and '土地徵收' involve land use changes that can impact terrestrial ecosystems, which Model A missed."
    },
    "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B provides significantly stronger and more explicit evidence by listing specific case studies ('文林苑都更案', '美河市聯開案估價爭議', '苗栗大埔徵收案', '地上權住宅爭議案例探討') that directly involve disputes, governance, and justice issues, making its reasoning much clearer than Model A's general statement."
    },
    "Partnerships for the Goals": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B identifies '促參案' and '聯合開發' as examples of external multi-stakeholder collaborations, which align more directly with the SDG's intent of broader societal partnerships, and also includes '領導與團隊合作並進之精神與國際觀' from core competencies."
