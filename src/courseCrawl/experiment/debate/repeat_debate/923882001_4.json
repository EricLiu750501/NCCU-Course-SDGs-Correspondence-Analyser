    "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions": {
      "winner": "A",
      "justification": "Both models provide strong explicit evidence for justice and governance. Model A's inclusion of 'civic engagement and political activism' provides a slightly more direct link to the 'Peace' and 'Strong Institutions' aspects of the SDG."
    },
    "Partnerships for the Goals": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B makes a strong and well-justified inference by connecting the course's emphasis on 'collaboration', 'civic engagement', and rebuilding a 'shared urban commons' to the concept of partnerships for collective action. Model A found no evidence, which is an oversight."
