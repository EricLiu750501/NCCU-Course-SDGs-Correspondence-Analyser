      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B provides a significantly more extensive list of explicit evidence, including '文林苑都更案', '美河市聯開案估價爭議', and '地上權住宅爭議案例探討', all of which directly involve legal, policy, and justice aspects central to this SDG."
    },
    "Partnerships for the Goals": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B identifies strong explicit evidence with '促參案' (Public-Private Partnerships) and '聯合開發' (Joint Development) as multi-stakeholder collaborations. Additionally, it correctly links the core competency of '領導與團隊合作' to this SDG, which Model A completely missed."
