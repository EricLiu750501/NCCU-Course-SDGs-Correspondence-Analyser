    "Reduced Inequalities": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B correctly identifies '住宅補貼', '社會住宅', and '土地徵收' as explicit evidence for addressing housing and social inequalities, which Model A completely missed. Model B's score of 7.900 is well-justified."
    },
    "Sustainable Cities and Communities": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B includes '土地重劃' in its evidence, which is a key urban planning tool for sustainable development, making its evidence slightly more comprehensive than Model A's. Both scores are high and appropriate."
    },
    "Responsible Consumption and Production": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B explicitly links '綠建築' and '推案誘因探討' to sustainable practices in construction, which directly relates to responsible consumption and production. Model A completely missed this connection."
    },
    "Climate Action": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B makes a valid inferred connection through '綠建築', which contributes to climate action via energy efficiency. Model A missed this indirect link. Model B's score of 2.000 is appropriate."
    },
    "Life Below Water": {
      "winner": "Tie",
      "justification": "Both models correctly identify no relevant evidence for this SDG."
    },
    "Life on Land": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B makes a reasonable inferred connection through '土地重劃' and '土地徵收', which involve land use and management, even if the course's focus is not environmental. Model A missed this indirect link."
    },
    "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B provides more comprehensive explicit evidence by mentioning '爭議' cases like '文林苑都更案' in addition to '政策或制度' and '土地徵收', strengthening the link to justice and institutional roles. Its higher score of 8.700 is more fitting."
    },
    "Partnerships for the Goals": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B includes '聯合開發' and, crucially, '具備領導與團隊合作並進之精神與國際觀' from the core competencies, providing more comprehensive explicit evidence for partnerships and collaboration. Its higher score of 8.200 is more justified."
