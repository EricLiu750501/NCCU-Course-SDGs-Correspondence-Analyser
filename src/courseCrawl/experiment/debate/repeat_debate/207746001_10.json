    "Climate Action": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "While '綠建築' contributes to climate action, the course's specific focus on '推案誘因探討' makes the link to direct climate action less prominent. Model B's lower score and 'inferred' type more accurately reflect this indirect connection compared to Model A's higher score."
    },
    "Life Below Water": {
      "winner": "Tie",
      "justification": "Both models correctly identify no relevant evidence in the course description."
    },
    "Life on Land": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B reasonably infers an indirect link between '土地重劃' and '土地徵收' (land use changes) and their potential impact on land ecosystems, even if the course's focus is economic/legal, which Model A completely missed."
    },
    "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B provides a much stronger justification by highlighting the course's analysis of '政策或制度' and numerous '爭議' cases (like '文林苑都更案' and '土地徵收'), which directly address issues of justice, governance, and institutional roles. Model A significantly underestimated this link."
    },
    "Partnerships for the Goals": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B correctly identifies explicit mentions of '促參案' (Public-Private Partnerships), '聯合開發' (joint development), and '團隊合作' as a core competency, all directly relevant to SDG 17, which Model A completely missed."
