    "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B provides a more comprehensive list of explicit evidence, including specific controversial cases like '文林苑都更案' and '美河市聯開案估價爭議', which directly highlight governance, justice, and institutional issues. Its higher score is well-justified."
    },
    "Partnerships for the Goals": {
      "winner": "A",
      "justification": "Model A's higher score is better justified by the explicit course topics on '促參案' (Public-Private Partnerships), 'BOT案' (Build-Operate-Transfer), and '聯合開發' (joint development), which are direct forms of multi-stakeholder partnerships for development."
