      "justification": "Both models identify '綠建築,' but Model B provides a more nuanced justification, acknowledging that while relevant, the course focuses on market incentives rather than explicit production or consumption practices, leading to a more appropriate lower score."
    },
    "Climate Action": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Both models link '綠建築,' but Model B's justification is more precise, noting that while green building has climate benefits, the syllabus does not explicitly frame it as climate action or mitigation strategies, warranting a lower score."
    },
    "Life Below Water": {
      "winner": "Tie",
      "justification": "No relevant evidence found in the course syllabus for either model."
    },
    "Life on Land": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Both models identify '土地重劃' and '土地徵收,' but Model B's justification is more accurate in clarifying that while these impact land use, the course does not explicitly focus on terrestrial ecosystem conservation, thus warranting a slightly lower score."
    },
    "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B provides extensive and explicit evidence by listing numerous '爭議' cases (e.g., 文林苑都更案, 苗栗大埔徵收案) that directly involve policy, justice, and institutional frameworks, making its connection to this SDG much stronger than Model A's."
    },
    "Partnerships for the Goals": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B correctly identifies '促參案' (Public-Private Partnerships) and '聯合開發' as direct examples of multi-stakeholder collaborations, and '領導與團隊合作' as a core competency, all of which are explicit evidence for this SDG."
