    "Decent Work and Economic Growth": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B provides a much broader and more relevant justification by linking the course's focus on the '不動產市場', '實務工作', '促參案', and '都市更新' to economic activity and decent work opportunities. Model A's evidence is too narrow."
    },
    "Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B offers significantly more comprehensive explicit evidence, including '促參案', '聯合開發', '社會住宅', and '創新' as a core competency, which directly aligns with infrastructure development and innovation."
    },
    "Reduced Inequalities": {
      "winner": "Tie",
      "justification": "Both models identify '住宅補貼' and '社會住宅' as key explicit evidence for addressing housing inequalities. Their scores are very close and both justifications are strong."
    },
    "Sustainable Cities and Communities": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B provides more comprehensive explicit evidence by including '社會住宅' and '綠建築' alongside '都市更新' and '土地重劃', all of which are crucial for creating sustainable and inclusive urban environments."
    },
    "Responsible Consumption and Production": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B strengthens the link to responsible production by including '推案誘因探討' (incentives for green building projects) in its evidence, which directly relates to sustainable practices in the construction industry."
    },
    "Climate Action": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B's lower score and 'inferred' evidence type are more accurate. While '綠建築' has climate benefits, the course does not explicitly focus on climate action, making the link indirect."
    },
    "Life Below Water": {
      "winner": "Tie",
      "justification": "Both models correctly identify no explicit or inferred evidence for this SDG in the course description."
    },
    "Life on Land": {
      "winner": "A",
      "justification": "Model A is more accurate by assigning a minimal score. While '土地重劃' and '土地徵收' involve land use, the syllabus focuses on economic/legal aspects, not environmental conservation or biodiversity, making Model B's inferred connection too weak."
    },
    "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B provides a much stronger and broader justification by highlighting the course's analysis of '政策或制度' and numerous '爭議' cases like '文林苑都更案' and '土地徵收', which directly relate to justice and institutional roles."
    },
    "Partnerships for the Goals": {
      "winner": "Tie",
      "justification": "Both models correctly identify '促參案' (Public-Private Partnerships) as strong, explicit evidence. Model B also includes '聯合開發' and '團隊合作', providing slightly more comprehensive evidence, but Model A's score for the primary evidence is also very reasonable."
