      "justification": "Model B includes 'The Urban Heat Island Effect' as a relevant climate-related topic, in addition to 'Coping with Global Climate Change' and 'climate action planning', providing a more complete picture and justifying its higher score."
    },
    "Life Below Water": {
      "winner": "Tie",
      "justification": "Both models correctly identify no evidence for this SDG."
    },
    "Life on Land": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Both models correctly infer relevance from 'Urban Ecology and Green Networks' and 'green infrastructure'. Model B's slightly higher score is reasonable for this direct connection to terrestrial ecosystems in cities."
    },
    "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B's explicit mention of 'Environmental and Social Justice' as a dedicated topic and 'city governance' provides stronger and more direct evidence, justifying its slightly higher score."
    },
    "Partnerships for the Goals": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B explicitly identifies 'collaboration', 'civic engagement', and 'rebuilding a shared urban commons' as strong indicators of partnerships, which is more direct than Model A's inference from case studies."
