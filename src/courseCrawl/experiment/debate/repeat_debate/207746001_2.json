    "Responsible Consumption and Production": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model A found no evidence. Model B correctly infers a connection through '綠建築' and '推案誘因探討', which implies consideration of sustainable practices in the construction industry, a valid, albeit indirect, link."
    },
    "Climate Action": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Both models link to '綠建築'. Model B's reasoning is more nuanced, acknowledging the indirect contribution of green buildings to climate action but noting the course's lack of explicit focus on climate mitigation strategies, leading to a more appropriate lower score."
    },
    "Life Below Water": {
      "winner": "Tie",
      "justification": "Both models correctly identified no relevant evidence in the course description."
    },
    "Life on Land": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model A found no evidence. Model B identifies a very weak, indirect link through '土地重劃' and '土地徵收' related to land use, and appropriately scores it low, acknowledging the focus is not on environmental conservation."
    },
    "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B's reasoning is more comprehensive, explicitly mentioning '政策或制度', '爭議' cases like '文林苑都更案', and '土地徵收', which directly highlight issues of justice and institutional roles in real estate."
    },
    "Partnerships for the Goals": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B provides a more thorough justification, including '聯合開發' and '團隊合作' (a core competency) in addition to '促參案', all of which explicitly align with the concept of partnerships."
