      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B's evidence is more comprehensive, including '不動產貸款', '不動產稅賦', '內政部修法', and '地政事務所參訪', which directly relate to legal frameworks, policy, and institutional functions, aligning better with SDG 16."
    },
    "Partnerships for the Goals": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B's reasoning is more accurate; while '團隊合作' and '國際觀' are mentioned as core competencies, they are general skills rather than explicit engagement in multi-stakeholder partnerships for sustainable development, which is the specific focus of SDG 17. Model A's score is too generous for this indirect link."
