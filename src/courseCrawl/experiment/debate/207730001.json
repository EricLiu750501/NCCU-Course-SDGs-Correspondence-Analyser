    "Climate Action": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B's slightly higher score is justified by emphasizing climate change as a new planning concept and a dedicated week of study, indicating strong integration within the course."
    },
    "Life Below Water": {
      "winner": "A",
      "justification": "The mention of '基隆河谷廊帶' (Keelung River Valley Corridor) is a case study for cross-domain governance, not an explicit focus on aquatic ecosystems or life below water. Model B's inference is too tenuous."
    },
    "Life on Land": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B's evidence ('國土復育與防災' - land restoration and disaster prevention, '國土復育促進地區' - land restoration promotion areas) is much more direct and comprehensive for the conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems."
    },
    "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions": {
      "winner": "B",
      "justification": "Model B's analysis is better, linking the extensive legal framework and institutional focus to indigenous rights and reconciliation, which directly addresses the justice aspect of SDG 16."
    },
    "Partnerships for the Goals": {
      "winner": "A",
      "justification": "Model A's evidence, including '與其他相關法規及制度密切相關' (closely related to other relevant laws and systems), is a strong and direct indicator of inter-institutional partnerships and collaboration, which is a core aspect of 'cross-domain governance' mentioned in the syllabus."
