##  課程簡介Course Description
This course offers students a strategic and applied understanding of virtual and real-world asset tokenization, focusing on its disruptive potential across finance, real estate, investment management, and emerging digital economies. Designed for future leaders in fintech, banking, asset management, and regulatory strategy, the course explores how blockchain-based tokenization transforms traditional asset classes into programmable, fractionalized, and highly liquid instruments. Through a business-centric lens, students will examine the core technological enablers—such as smart contracts and distributed ledger systems—while emphasizing the economic logic behind token design, value flows, and market incentives. Particular focus is placed on the integration of tokenized assets into institutional portfolios, the rise of token-based fundraising, and the strategic role of tokenization in decentralizing capital markets and supply chains. The course also delves into the regulatory implications of tokenized assets, comparing global frameworks across the U.S., EU, and Asia, with attention to securities classification, investor protections, AML/KYC obligations, and emerging legal definitions of digital ownership. Students will critically assess how regulatory environments shape go-to-market strategies and cross-border expansion for tokenized asset platforms. Pedagogically, the course combines lectures, real-world case studies, and group projects to equip students with the tools to:
  * Identify high-potential tokenization use cases across industries
  * Evaluate the viability and risks of tokenized business models
  * Formulate compliant token strategies aligned with market and legal realities
  * Understand the interplay between DeFi innovation, NFT markets, and institutional finance

By the end of the course, students will be capable of making informed strategic decisions around the design, deployment, and scaling of tokenization initiatives, whether as entrepreneurs, consultants, investors, or policymakers navigating the future of digitized assets.
