##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
The objective is to increase interaction across different areas of study in finance and economics, to build research connections across various research institutes, and to enrich the research content among participants.
##  每周課程進度與作業要求 Course Schedule & Requirements
The course content is planned as follows:
1. The first class on September 5 will provide an introduction to the course content and requirements.
2. October 10 and October 24 are national holidays, so no speakers will be scheduled on those dates.
3. Speakers will be arranged to present on various research topics during the remaining weeks. 
4. The final class will be held on December 19.
Students are expected to actively engage in the seminar by interacting with the presenter and participating in a post-talk discussion about the presenter’s research ideas. Students are required to submit five written reports by the end of this course. The written report not only summarizes the paper but also shows a comprehensive understanding of the research topic and the methodological innovations. These reports should take the form of referee reports typically required by academic journals. Students should assume the role of a journal referee, providing a thorough discussion along with major and minor comments on the article.
