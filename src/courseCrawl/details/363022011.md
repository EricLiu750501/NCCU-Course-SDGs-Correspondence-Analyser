##  評量工具與策略、評分標準成效Evaluation Criteria
**Grading Components & Course Policies**
**Participation (100 points)**
  * Full attendance earns 100 points.
  * One unexcused absence is allowed without penalty; each additional unexcused absence deducts 10 points per class.
  * Advance notice is required for **all** absences, regardless of reason.


**In-Class Discussion (400 points)**
  * Case and course-material participation is evaluated each session by three student volunteers.
  * Rating scale per session: useless (0), useful (1), good (3), very good (5).
  * The **median** of the three ratings is recorded as the session score.


**Final Report (150 points; team-based)**
  * Topic and requirements will be announced in class.
  * Maximum 15 pages, 1.5 line spacing, 12-point Times New Roman or 新細明體 (excluding title page, references, and appendices).
  * Grading: in-class presentation (75 points) + written report (75 points).


**Exams (350 points)**
  * Combined total for the midterm and final is 350 points.


**Note:** Your draft said “400 points” here; I’ve aligned it to 350 to keep the overall total at 1,000. If you intended 400, I can adjust the section totals accordingly.
**Peer Evaluation**
  * Conducted in the final week and may adjust individual grades within group-based components.


**Final Course Grade**
  * Final grades are assigned on a curve fitted to total weighted scores.


**Group Work Policy**
  * A substantial portion of the course involves group work. Collaborative efforts often yield richer insights, but group dynamics must be managed carefully.
  * Free-riding is strongly discouraged; avoid splitting the assignment into isolated parts for individuals.
  * Recommended workflow: each member completes the full assignment independently, then the group meets to synthesize a collective submission.
  * Groups in which all members actively contribute typically produce the highest-quality work. Review submissions collectively to minimize errors and maximize understanding.
