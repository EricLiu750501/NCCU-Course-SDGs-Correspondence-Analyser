##  評量工具與策略、評分標準成效Evaluation Criteria
**Grading and Requirements:**
  * **Homework and Assignments (****25****%)**  
  
Homework will be assigned throughout the semester and will be based on the materials covered in class. All homework should be handed in **on time at the beginning of class**. Each assignment will be graded on a 100-point basis. **No late homework will be accepted****.****Any incomplete assignment will be checked but will receive no credits.**


  * **Quizzes (****20****%)**  
  
To ensure preparation, a brief quiz on the assigned readings will be administered during the first ten minutes of each class. The quizzes may include true/false questions, short answers, or other question types.


  * **Final****Presentation****(****35****%)**  
  
Each student is required to prepare a final presentation on a topic of their choice. A written paper is not required; however, students must prepare a presentation slide deck. The presentation should be 25 minutes long, including 5 minutes for Q&A.
  * **Class Participation (****10****%)**  
  
The instructor expects **active participation** from students in class and encourages them to ask questions and share outside knowledge at all times during class. 


  * **Attendance (****10****%)**  
  
For each 1-hour unexcused absence, **1 point** will be deducted from this portion of the grade. Any official documentation for absences needs to be submitted to the instructor within **3 days** after the student returns to class or else the student’s absence will be counted as an**unexcused absence** and the student may incur the **1****-****point penalty**. 


The class sign-in sheet is only available for the **first 10 minutes** of class, so if students do not arrive by then, it will be counted as absent. **Leaving class early is not allowed** unless there is an emergency. In **rare** situations when students have to leave the class early, they need to obtain the instructor’s permission **before** class begins. Otherwise, leaving early will count as an unexcused absence.  

**This syllabus is provisional; the final version will be confirmed after assessing students’ levels.**
