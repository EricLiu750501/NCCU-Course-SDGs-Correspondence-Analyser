##  課程簡介Course Description
This course familiarizes students with several flagship large‑scale international survey data, including the World Values Survey (WVS), East Asian Social Survey (EASS), International Social Survey Programme (ISSP), Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), and the WHO Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE). Through a combination of lectures, hands‑on exercises, a research proposal, and a final empirical project, students will master cross‑national survey design, data cleaning and documentation, weighting, measurement validity checks, cross‑country dataset integration, data analysis and hypothesis testing, and concise written and oral reporting. Demonstrations in class will use R. However, students may complete assignments with any statistical software (e.g., Python, Stata, SAS, SPSS, etc.). There are no formal prerequisites for this course. However, prior completion of (or concurrent enrolment in) an introductory statistics or quantitative research‐methods course is strongly recommended.

##  評量工具與策略、評分標準成效Evaluation Criteria
  1. **Problem Sets (30%):** Three problem sets (each 10 %). For every assignment, you will analyze one or more of the international datasets introduced in class, applying techniques covered in lectures. Submit both your code (R, Python, Stata, SPSS, or another software) and the resulting output. Collaboration is encouraged, but each student must run the code independently and turn in their own work. Because an answer key is released immediately after the deadline, late submissions are accepted only when an extension is approved in advance or, in an unforeseen emergency, retroactively.
  2. **Paper Reading Notes (20%):** Two assignments (each 10 %). For each, select a journal article that meets the instructor’s criteria and complete structured reading notes by answering guided questions. These tasks build your ability to read research critically and extract insights relevant to your own work.
  3. **Research Project (40%):** Group project for undergraduates; individual project for graduate students. Design and carry out an original empirical study with an international dimension—either a cross-national comparison or an analysis that combines samples from at least two countries. The study must present clear research questions, theory-based hypotheses, appropriate data analysis, and conclusions drawn from the findings. The final paper, written in English, should be about 5,000–10,000 words (excluding references).
    1.       1. **Proposal (5%):** Proposal Workshop on Nov. 6. Written proposal due Nov. 12.
      2. **Presentation (10%):** Presentations will take place on Dec. 11 and Dec. 18.
      3. **Final Paper (25%):** Due Dec. 24.
  4. **Attendance** **and Participation (10%):** You may miss up to three classes without explanation. Additional absences must comply with the National Chengchi University Student Leave of Absence Rules (國立政治大學學生請假規則).


**Late Submission Policy:** Written works are due at 23:59 on the stated date. Problem sets cannot be submitted late. For paper-reading notes and research project, late submissions will lose 10 percent of the available points for each 24-hour period past the deadline, unless the instructor has approved an extension in advance or grants a waiver afterward due to an unforeseen emergency. An unexcused absence from a scheduled presentation without prior arrangement earns a grade of zero for that component.
**Guidelines for the Use of Generative AI Tools in the Classroom**
  * The use of AI tools for basic proofreading is allowed and does not require acknowledgment.
  * Any use of AI beyond basic proofreading and text editing must be fully acknowledged, including where and how the AI was used.
  * It is prohibited to use AI tools to generate content for assignments without meaningful input from the student.
  * Violating this policy will be treated as plagiarism. Consequences may include receiving a zero for the relevant component or the entire assignment. In serious cases, the violation will be reported to the university.
