##  課程簡介Course Description
Intermediate Business Oral Training course gives students an insight of the business world by exposing them to knowledge of the English language skills, especially in the speaking skill area, necessary to succeed. With English being the language of international communication, students will be trained to communicate clearly and coherently in English to be globally competitive.
Much class time will be devoted to student-led activities allowing students to speak up in a controlled, business-like yet relaxed atmosphere. Materials will first be introduced in the general context before being framed for business situations. In and outside of class, students will have the opportunity to work individually to foster learner autonomy; they will also work in groups to develop the concept of teamwork and justify the significance of team spirit to boosting productivity.
