##  課程簡介Course Description
This course delves into the rapidly evolving world of immersive technologies—including Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR)—and their integration into broader platforms. As these technologies transition from speculative futures to practical tools embedded in daily life, it becomes increasingly important to understand their design principles, societal implications, and real-world applications. Students will explore both theoretical frameworks and hands-on approaches, leveraging immersive technologies to address challenges in fields such as marketing, healthcare, education, public engagement, and urban planning. Students will begin with needs analysis to identify and articulate how these technologies can be applied to real-world problems. They will then prototype solutions and conduct evaluations to assess their impact and feasibility. Through collaborative group work, students will gain fluency in both conceptual understanding and practical implementation, preparing them to critically and creatively apply immersive technologies in diverse contexts.
