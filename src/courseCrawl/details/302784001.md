##  課程簡介Course Description
Sustainable finance has become inextricably integrated into the capital markets in order to support economic growth and reduce environment problem. The financial system is integral to achieving a smooth transition to a low carbon economy. Sustainable innovation is a process where sustainability considerations (environmental, social, financial) are integrated into company systems from idea generation through to research and development and commercialization. The course is designed to help the students gain an understanding of the sustainability development goals (SDGs), initiatives and regulations that support to develop the sustainable financial systems. This applies to products, services and technologies, as well as new business and organization model that are able to embed environmental, social and governance considerations. In addition, sustainable finance includes a strong green finance and climate finance components that aim to support economic growth while reducing pressures on the environment, addressing green-house gas emissions and tackling pollution, minimizing waste and improving efficiency in the use of natural resources. Therefore, we will also cover the full scope of sustainable finance providing an integrated view on investing, banking, and insurance
