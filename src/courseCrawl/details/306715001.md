##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
The course objectives are the in-depth discussions on issues regarding developing the Agentic AI applications in Finance on the infrastructure of PyTorch/TensorFlow and GPUs. Particularly, we will study the PyTorch/TensorFlow framework that enables the Agentic AI applications performing on AMD’s GPU. Students will learn from the practice on developing he Agentic AI applications in Finance via some practical final project. At the end of this course, students should gain: (1) the general knowledge on a methodology of developing the Agentic AI applications in Finance on the infrastructure of PyTorch/TensorFlow and AMD’s GPU, and (2) the hands-on development experience on Agentic AI applications in Finance with PyTorch/TensorFlow and AMD’s GPU.

##  評量工具與策略、評分標準成效Evaluation Criteria
1. GRADE DISTRIBUTION: 
Weekly meeting attendance (1% x 16) 16% 
Meeting participation 14% 
Homework 30% 
Term project deliverable 40% 
Total 100% 
2. CONTRIBUTION EVALUATION:
You are expected to attend each meeting on time with the assigned readings prepared in advance and to contribute to the meeting discussion either by starting the discussion or building on the contribution of others to move the discussion forward. The sharing of your experience and insights is a key part of the leaning process. To build on the contribution of others requires you to listen and to consider the timing of your participation. 
Meaningful meeting participation will be a factor in the determination of your grade. As in all meetings the more you put into a meeting the more you get out of it. We encourage the sharing of ideas with the meeting during meeting discussions. You are of course responsible for all material discussed in meeting even if you are absent. If you miss a meeting you must get notes from someone else in the meeting and you should designate someone to pick up any handouts for you. When you attend meeting you must be on time and remain for the entire meeting. 
The quality and frequency of your contribution will be taken into account in the grading scheme and will include the quality of your responses when cold called. You will be evaluated after every meeting session using the following criteria. Please note that contributions are NOT equivalent to only attending meeting or talking in meeting. The quality of what is said and of one's listening and responding to others are important components of my evaluation. 
Excellent Participation (A): (1) regularly initiates meeting discussions; (2) contributes consistently to meeting discussions; (3) regularly gives indication of substantial knowledge and insights; (4) frequently facilitates others in clarifying and developing their own viewpoints; (5) regularly builds on the thinking of others and integrates that thinking into own contributions to produce a larger synergistic understanding of the issues being discussed. 
Good Participation (B): (1) frequently initiates meeting discussions; (2) contributes consistently to meeting discussions; (3) regularly gives indication of substantial knowledge and insights; (4) occasionally facilitates others in clarifying and developing their own viewpoints. 
Fair Participation (C): (1) occasionally initiates meeting discussions; (2) contributes occasionally to meeting discussions; (3) gives indication of some knowledge and insights; (4) almost never responds constructively to the contribution of others. 
Poor Participation (D): (1) never or almost never initiates meeting discussions; (2) never or almost never contributes to meeting discussions; (3) is late for, does not attend, or is not prepared for 3 or more meetings; (4) actively inhibits or impedes the course of discussion; (5) exhibits defensive behavior such as aggression or withdrawal rather than being thoughtful and considerate of others' ideas. 
Failing Participation (F): (1) never or almost never initiates meeting discussions; (2) never or almost never contributes to meeting discussions; (3) is late for, does not attend, or is not prepared for 6 or more meetings; (4) actively inhibits or impedes the course of discussion; (5) exhibits defensive behavior such as aggression or withdrawal rather than being thoughtful and considerate of others' ideas.
