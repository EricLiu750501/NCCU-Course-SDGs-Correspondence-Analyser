##  課程簡介Course Description
The course is designed to instill translation theories and critical concepts in the English majors, to develop their translation potential, and to refine their translation skills by means of translation exercises studied at home and followed by corrections and in-depth discussions in the classroom that contribute to balancing abstract academic theories and practical translation skills so as to cultivate English-Chinese translation talents of professional attainment in both source and target languages. Essential theories and issues regarding cross-cultural as well as literary renditions—their limits, challenges and transcendences—will be elaborated and explored; practical information about translation studies, related important online or paper-based tools, and the _métier_ itself will be also introduced. A variety of pertinent and flexible tactics, strategies and skills needed to tackle with different kinds of English or Chinese text types will be taught, analyzed, compared as well as drilled throughout the course.
