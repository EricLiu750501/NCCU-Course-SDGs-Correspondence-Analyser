##  課程簡介Course Description
The purpose of this course is to prepare students to articulate effectively by exposing them to a diversity of speaking or written materials, including TED/YouTube talks, lectures, speeches, tongue twisters, etc. Each week before class, students are required to listen to or read the assigned learning materials and prepare for the oral presentations or sharing of their thoughts about the assigned materials. 
In class, students will give an individual presentation based on the assigned videos or articles. After the presentation, based on the learning materials and the weekly topic, students are expected to share the main points they learn, express their opinions, ask and answer questions, and give feedbacks about their classmates' speaking following the Socratic discussion principles. 
There will be several online or in-person conversation sessions or workshops which students are encouraged to join voluntarily. Students will be given opportunities to interact in English with students from other countries and share their knowledge after class.
