##  課程簡介Course Description
This course aims to provide an introduction of social issues and social problems of the American society. We see a lot of news about US society almost every day: those issues, situations, behaviors, and ideas, which are perceived and labeled as problematic and for which a solution is seen as possible and necessary. In this class, we will be learning about some of these social issues of the American society. But we will also be learning about what constitutes a social problem. We will examine these questions drawing on case studies of contemporary issues, like inequality, racism, mass incarceration, healthcare, and of course, covid and the pandemic.

##  評量工具與策略、評分標準成效Evaluation Criteria
1. Class Participation 30%
This class pays attention to class participation. Each student is expected to voice his/her opinions and ideas in order to get a good grade from class participation. Simply sitting in the classroom without participation in the classroom discussion will not result in a good grade in this part.
2 Quizzes 40%
There will be several in-class quizzes (i.e., multiple choice). The purpose of these quizzes is to test students’ understanding of principles and concepts of the readings. If you miss a short quiz, you will not be able to take a make-up quiz.
3 In-Class Presentation 30%
Each student is required to do an in-class presentation in any topic that is related to the U.S. society. The presentation should be approximately 15-20 minutes and will hold in the last two classes. The purpose of the presentation is to train students to present in international meetings. Please tell me the topic of your presentation by 10/24. I will give more instructions on the presentation in class.
