##  課程簡介Course Description
This course aims to provide an introduction of social issues and social problems of the American society. We see a lot of news about US society almost every day: those issues, situations, behaviors, and ideas, which are perceived and labeled as problematic and for which a solution is seen as possible and necessary. In this class, we will be learning about some of these social issues of the American society. But we will also be learning about what constitutes a social problem. We will examine these questions drawing on case studies of contemporary issues, like inequality, racism, mass incarceration, healthcare, and of course, covid and the pandemic.
