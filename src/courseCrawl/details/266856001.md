##  課程簡介Course Description
The emergence of sharing economy is seen as an economic revolution or a disruptive innovation to the capitalistic market-mediated exchange. This new economic paradigm marks the rise of crowd-based capitalism, enabled by the development of digital technologies. In about 10-years time, different models of sharing economy sweep the world and change the human lifestyle.
Despite the fact that various sharing economy activities have penetrated into our daily lives, questions and debates about the legitimacy as well as the social and cultural impact brought by this new form of economic model continue.
This course aims to provide students’ with knowledge and insight about the new economic paradigm of sharing economy, from the research perspective.
