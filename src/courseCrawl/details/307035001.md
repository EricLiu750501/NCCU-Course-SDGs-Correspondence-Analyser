##  課程簡介Course Description
Derivatives are financial instruments whose payoffs are derived from those of other financial instruments. The use of derivatives has grown enormously during the last several decades. Certain types of derivatives are traded actively in the exchange, while the vast majority of derivatives are transacted in the over-the-counter markets. Derivatives provide a means of managing financial risk. Financial institutions and individuals can use derivatives to hedge, speculate and control financial risks. Therefore it is essential for students to develop a familiarity of different financial derivatives and their risk characteristics.
