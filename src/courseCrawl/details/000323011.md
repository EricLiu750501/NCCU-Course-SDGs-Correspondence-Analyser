This course is the first course in a three-semester sequence of Intermediate Accounting. This course aims to help students gain in-depth understanding of the concepts and principles of financial reporting processes. The course shows students how the economic transactions of a firm are prepared and reported in the financial statements and related disclosures. Students will develop their skills to prepare, read, and use financial statements. After taking this course, students are expected to become both sophisticated preparers and users of financial accounting information.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course is designed to provide you with an in-depth understanding of the subjects covered by the materials: intermediate financial accounting. The nature of this course is demanding and challenging. It is time-consuming for a college student beyond freshman year to master the subject. To succeed, you need to devote serious efforts both during and outside of classes. If you do not intend to spend time on this subject, it is suggested that you should not take this course. Come to each class meeting prepared. 
The course materials are presented through a mix of class lectures, assigned readings, and problems. You should maximize your understanding of the materials by attending and participating in class lectures and discussions. To be successful, you are expected to do the following: 
  1. read the assigned readings and be prepared before you come to the class. 
  2. arrive on time. 
  3. be actively involved in class by asking questions and participating in discussions. 
  4. review the assigned reading and attempt all homework problems after the class. 


After you have done everything you are expected to do, if you still have difficulty with the materials we discuss in class, my office hours are available for you.
Important Notes and Policies 
  1. Exams must be taken as scheduled. No makeup exam will be given under any circumstances. 
  2. Leaving classroom without permission during the exam will be penalized.
  3. Proper classroom manner at all times is expected. 
  4. Turn off your cell-phone during the class session.

##  評量工具與策略、評分標準成效Evaluation Criteria
**Grading policies**
**1. Paper Exams:**
Three exams will be administered in this course. Your highest score among three exams will be 50% of your term grade. The second and third highest scores from the rest of two exams will be 30% and 20%, respectively.
**2. Homework and Term Project:**
Two homework (at least) and a term project will be assigned during this course. Fail to submit a homework will result a 25% deduction of your final grade. Fail to submit the term project will result a 50% reduction of your final grade. 
**3. Calculation of Final Grade**
(Exam with highest score * 50% + Exam with second highest score * 30% + Exam with least score * 20%) * (Submission of the first homework * 25% + Submission of the second homework * 25% + Submission of the term project * 50%)
I expect you to come to each class meeting, but I will not take attendance on a regular basis. However, I will randomly take attendance just to get to know who are taking the course and the randomly taken attendance will be a reference to tell me who comes to class meetings and who does not. Your term grade will be based on the exams given in the classes. Exams will be administered on scheduled dates.
