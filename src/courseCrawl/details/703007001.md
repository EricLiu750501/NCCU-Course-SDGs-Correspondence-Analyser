##  課程簡介Course Description
This is a fundamental mathematical course for computer science students. It is intended to introduce to the students basic discrete mathematical tools and skills that are needed in the study of computer science. These skills/tools include
1. mathematical reasoning: for the student be able to read comprehend and construct mathematical arguments  
2. combinatorial analysis and discrete structures: knowledge of which is essential in problem solving/modeling and  
3. algorithmic thinking: that would be helpful in the specification verification and analysis of computer algorithms/programs. Topics introduced in the course include logic induction counting recurrence relations relations graphs and trees.
