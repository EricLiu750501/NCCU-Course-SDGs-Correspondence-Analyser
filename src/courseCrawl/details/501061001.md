##  課程簡介Course Description
# 課程簡介 Course Description
ENGLISH ORAL COMMUNICATION AND READING (THREE) is a continuation in classroom 
instruction and experience in oral communication skills, particularly those related to public presentation, group discussion, and more. According to the English Department’s EFL Committee Mission Statement, the goal for students in this course is that they should demonstrate reasonable fluency and pronunciation in standard English. Ability to participate comfortably in general conversation is determined by: Comprehending and responding appropriately, Initiating, continuing, and ending a conversation, Interacting with cultural awareness, Improvising in new situations, Using grammar flexibly, Seeking and providing information in an organized manner, and Narrating an event. The course approaches communication, comprehension, fluency, improvisational language structures, and communication theory. The course will use a great deal of culture-specific materials, such as videos and critical thinking/communication exercises.
This semester’s curriculum incorporates a very strong New Media program in which students will engage in language learning through realia in the form of tabletop roleplaying games, specifically we will utilize the A.C.E. (_Awfully Cheerful Engine_) system as a language learning and practice tool.
This course requires students to use AI extensively as a personal resource to improve their language skills. Students must have an account (free is okay) with Gemini (Google) and/or ChatGPT (OpenAI). You must be familiar with using text and voice modes with the chatbots. Some assignments will require that you video yourself using the resources for language learning/practice activities.
Students will be required to setup an AI English Study Buddy program (you will be taught the principles of doing this; most AI programs have a free tier you can use on PC and/or mobile). You will be asked to practice your English skills with the AI Buddy outside of class as well as complete certain classroom assignments with the AI Buddy.
This semester, we may include a special section on the use of Virtual Reality in communication, narrative form, and media-based discourse construction (pandemic willing).
Depending upon student feedback, we may incorporate a form of a teaching approach known as GAMIFICATION as well as GAMIZATION, using fantasy card, board, and tabletop games in contexts adapted to the language learning classroom. If/when we are holding class online due to pandemic prevention protocols, we use Discord and perhaps Owlbear Rodeo for Virtual Table Top (VTT) sessions. We may also use particular card and board games (again, based upon student feedback).
This course is taught in English in an English environment only. Please note students from outside the English Department who have not taken the prerequisite courses must be able to understand English to an appropriate level for this course.
Obviously, whether we meet in person or online due to pandemic response protocols or other factors will affect some of our course content. Also, obviously, for in-person classes, students must scan the QR code when required (in addition to answering roll call as they are different procedures) and wear a mask while observing social distancing.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
# 課程目標與學習成效 Goals & Learning Outcomes
## 課程目標 Course Objectives
**Oral Training Goals** : The goal of this semester is to continue to develop competence in using English to present information in informal and formal settings. Students must be able to organize and deliver formal and informal presentations in front of an audience. They should be able to quickly organize an informal presentation when asked to share thoughts, information, or opinions on the spot. When given time to prepare, they should be able to make organized and effective presentations that include the use of visual aids that meet the required guidelines for informative and persuasive speeches.
**Reading Goals** : The general goal of the course is to improve the students’ ability to converse on subjects in a variety of content areas. Students may also acquire specific knowledge on the hows and whys of constructing specific types of speeches or participate in discussions. The reading component should focus on articles in these and other related subject areas and on readings from speech and communication textbooks. Authentic materials intended for native English speakers will be adopted as the major source of material for student readings.
## 學習成效 Specific Learning Outcomes
This course employs the following: Conversation Blueprints, Improvisational Language Structures, 
Interactive Drama Role Plays, Storytelling, Tabletop Pole Play, Gamification, Panel and Group Discussion, among others. In addition to oral training components, the course has reading components with appropriate assignments to focus on skill sets as outlined in the English Department's program guidelines. Student skill progress will be assessed in general as to how they perform the goal skills within these various activity metrics – particularly in individual speechmaking, discussion-based activities, and communication projects while communication theory and related concepts will be evaluated via exams, quizzes, and performance. As per the oral training guidelines, students will develop and improve the following specific skillsets:
  * Further development of social skills
  * Group discussions of the reading articles
  * Skills for group dynamics, group decision making, and group leadership
  * Presentations of opinions concerning the reading materials
  * Informal and formal speech making
  * Critical thinking skills
  * Expanding and developing vocabulary


Students should prepare an online drive (Google Drive is suggested) to upload to in order submit periodically class video assignments and other homework on it.
## Course Content and Core Ability Items
How the Course Content relates to the Core Ability Items:
To understand, analyze, and synthesize information in English and to fully express oneself and to communicate with others clearly in oral English.
  * To actively and efficiently express an opinion or to discuss a specialized subject for at least ten minutes - students will be asked to research a number of topics as the fodder for various speaking assignments. These will afford students the opportunity to practice expressing opinions based upon critical ideas. Assessment will determine how well students retain comprehension of the material.
  * To make few mistakes in grammar, vocabulary or pronunciation and to converse fluently – obviously, speaking assignments and speeches will afford students the opportunity to express themselves. Conversation activities will afford students the opportunity to practice and improve within a Communicative Language Learning model. 


Assessment will determine how well students retain comprehension of the material.
  * To understand the expressions used different occasions, including daily conversation, broadcasting, speeches, etc. – as part of their instruction in the content of the course, the students will become more aware of register and role as well as be afforded practice opportunities – particularly for formal and semi-formal contexts. Assessment will determine how well students retain comprehension of the material.
  * In routine situations, to provide information and exchange views – the roleplay, simulation, and conversational activities include opportunity to practice the exchange of ideas, information, and views. Assessment will determine how well students retain comprehension of the material.
  * To speak English with ease and fluency - ease will vary from students to student but the included practice in the course should help improve speaking stress issues and improve fluency through practice. Assessment will determine how well students retain comprehension of the material.
  * To be able to hold a fluent conversation for five minutes on a familiar subject – most speaking activities will be above five minutes while formal speeches will typically be around that level. Students will also be given the opportunity for longer speech actions as the course progresses. Assessment will determine how well students retain comprehension of the material.
  * To synthesize oral and written communication for discussion purposes – an important component of the course is readings as well as oral communication. Likewise, students will be asked to write responses and evaluations of their own and classmate performances. Assessment will determine how well students retain comprehension of the material.
  * To synthesize information on given subjects for formal oral presentations – student speeches will always be based upon original research synthesis. Assessment will determine how well students retain comprehension of the material.

Depending upon student feedback, we may incorporate a form of a teaching approach known as GAMIFICATION as well as GAMIZATION, using fantasy card, board, and tabletop games in contexts adapted to the language learning classroom. We would follow a sequence of activities ranging from conversational fantasy card games up through student generated sessions of tabletop roleplaying games such as the AWFULLY CHEERFUL ENGINE (ACE RPG). TRPG may be a component of in-class interaction. If/when we are holding class online due to pandemic prevention protocols, we use Discord and Owlbear Rodeo for Virtual Table Top (VTT) sessions. We may also use particular card and board games (again, based upon student feedback).

Faithful class attendance, Active and worthwhile participation, Oral Reports, Term Paper, projects, quizzes, and exams. In addition to keeping up with extensive reading assignments, students will be asked to view several films which showcase topics being explored or that are adapted from material under discussion. Group and individual projects are also commonly used to enhance the learning experience via creative interaction.
1. Regular attendance
2. Participation in classroom activities
3. Completion of assignments
4. Papers and Essays
5. Examinations
6. Review Questions & Pop Quizzes
Oral and Written Examinations. Participation. Fluency. Projects. Note that students receive participation points for each course session, so absences lower final grades. If a student has three unexcused absences then that student will not be allowed to participate in final projects or take the final examination. Five absences (excused or unexcused) lead to automatic failure in the course. Except in unusual cases late assignments will not be accepted. _Plagiarism may result in an automatic failure of the course_ (over-reliance on AI will count as plagiarism, particularly when not properly credited).
Please note, some assignments are yes/no points in which students receive a set number of points for completing on time and zero points if not. For essays, papers, and written assignments, the instructor does not edit or proofread submitted work. This is not a writing class per se so make certain you have edited your work prior to handing in (with credit to any AI used and without over-reliance on AI for any part of the work). You will receive a score for such work. Assignments may or may not be returned so students are encouraged to keep track of their work themselves.
**_Students should familiarize themselves with course policies_** , including those specifically related to Attendance, Participation, and Extra Credit opportunities (if any).
  * **ATTENDANCE & PARTICIPATION POLICY**: Attendance and  Participation in this course are required. Students who are tardy or absent will be penalized through lower possible participation points which leads to grade penalties. _Attendance is taken regularly and penalties are applied_. Typically, students receive on average fifteen to twenty participation points each class period (more or less depending upon activities of the week and actual participation – typically, a maximum of thirty participation points per session but only for very high-performing students; the typical is twenty). _Participation Grade Penalties are as follows_ : _Tardy_ , -5 participation points; _Second Hour Tardy_ , -10 participation points; _Absence_ , no participation points possible (this is true even if the absence is excused). _Use of Cellphone, tablet, computer, or mobile device without specific permission or instruction from the instructor_ , no participation points possible, -10 to -15 participation points and possibility of device being confiscated for the period (yes, just like elementary school students).


  * **_Attendance Points and Penalties are as follows_** : Absence means no participation points. _Three Unexcused Absences_ , not allowed to take final exam and zero points for final project; _Five Absences_ , automatically fail course. Note, students who missed the first few course sessions are still penalized for attendance and participation, even if they had not yet registered for the course.


  * Days in which students are scheduled to make presentations or in which interactive drama or similar activities are planned count as **DOUBLE ATTENDANCE DAYS** and all participation and attendance points or penalties are double. Days in which the course is scheduled with another class will count as **TRIPLE ATTENDANCE DAYS**.


  * **EXTRA CREDIT POLICY** : For the most current **Extra Credit policies** , please see the class _Facebook_ group files section . . . Students may makeup for points lost due to missed classes or gain additional grade points by completing optional extra credit activities. Extra credit is always optional. Regardless of the amount possible for particular extra credit opportunities, students may not earn more than five grade points for extra credit in a semester. Certain extra credit opportunities are not available to everyone and others are time sensitive. It is to your advantage to sign up for extra credit earlier rather than later to ensure that you are eligible and that the schedule allows for the activity. If you wish to pursue extra credit, do so early. _Extra Credit is typically NOT available within the last two weeks of the semester._


  * _**Missed Appointment**_ , if you make an appointment to see Dr. Phillips in his office and are tardy, -1 grade point; if you do not show, -2 grade points; if you do not contact Dr. Phillips and let him know you are missing the appointment by email at least twenty-four hours prior to the appointment or by phone within twenty-four hours, an additional -1 grade point. Failure to contact the instructor within one day before or after is an additional -1 grade point.


  * **_Taking Notes_** : University students are expected to have pen/pencil and paper with them during all class sessions. You should take notes during class of information presented in lecture or discussion as well as of content of media presentations. Please take notes with pen and paper and later transcribe to your digital note files (lit screens from mobile devices or notebook computers can be distracting to other students during class).


_At any time, students are free to ask to see their attendance record or grade scores_. Students receive points for completing assignments, participation, attendance, and other factors toward their final grade. A raw percentage is then figured based upon the total points possible. However, **_the final grade is set via a system that utilizes a curve grade formula after which any penalties from tardies or missed classes or bonuses from extra credit are applied_** so your final grave is not always the same as points earned within a particular time.
**人工智慧政策****Policy on Artificial Intelligence**
The English Department at National Chengchi University is embarking on an innovative journey to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into our English Language, Literature, TESOL, and Linguistics studies. This integration aligns with our educational goals, aiming to enhance the depth and breadth of our academic offerings. AI technologies, such as natural language processing tools and machine learning algorithms, will provide unique opportunities for personalized language learning, advanced literary analysis, in-depth linguistic research, and other academic pursuits.
Our vision is to leverage these AI tools to create a more dynamic, interactive, and effective learning environment. For example, AI can offer students tailored language exercises based on their proficiency levels or analyze complex literary texts, offering insights that might not be immediately apparent. In linguistics, AI can process large datasets, revealing patterns and trends that inform linguistic theories.
As per English Department policy,**individual course instructors are free to set their own policies regulating the use of generative AI tools in their courses, including allowing or disallowing some or all uses of such tools**. Course instructors should set such policies in their course syllabi and clearly communicate such policies to students. Students who are unsure of policies regarding generative AI tools are encouraged to ask their instructors for clarification. However, if such policies are not set for a course or particular assignment, the standard approach is as follows.
To give sufficient space for instructors to explore uses of generative AI tools in their courses, and to set clear guidelines to students about what uses are and are not consistent with our department’s policy on academic integrity, the following policy statement is adopted regarding generative AI in the context of coursework.
Absent a clear statement from a course instructor, use of or consultation with generative **_AI shall be treated analogously to assistance from another person_**. As you would not ask another person to do your assignments or take your tests for you, you should not ask AI to do your work in a similar manner. In particular, using generative AI tools to substantially complete an assignment or exam (e.g. by entering exam or assignment questions) is not permitted. Students should acknowledge the use of generative AI (other than incidental use) and default to disclosing such assistance when in doubt.
In THIS COURSE, some assignments may explicitly call for the use of AI tools. However, absent such explicit instruction, AI should either not be used or should be used as stated above. In the final revision of their assignments, students should acknowledge any use of AI and state how the technology was used (MLA, APA, Chicago, and other style books now have guides for such acknowledgment).
**Five Skills Unlikely To Be Disrupted By AI And How You Should Leverage Them As English Department Students**
The following pre-supposes that you do everything you can to master the skills and knowledge-sets of your course material. Certainly, AI can absolutely help you improve your speed and efficiency of gaining proficiency and even mastery but only if you use it well and do not use it as a crutch. If you ask AI to do the work for you, you will not learn and you will not gain mastery which means you will be much less competitive. It is very important that you learn to use AI in this new and changing world but that you do so as you build on your traditional skillsets. For instance, use AI as a Conversation partner or to quiz you on Literature readings or to give corrective advice to improve your writing. If you ask AI to write the homework, you will not improve and won’t learn from the corrections (always ask AI to give you suggestions for improvement and why it suggests this or that change and then remember the suggestions – actually take the suggestions onboard and LEARN, get better; that’s how you become competitive in the new world we are building).
Here are the five skills unlikely to be disrupted by AI, and how they can be leveraged in a world with increasing AI presence:
  * **Taste** : This isn't about culinary taste, but rather the ability to discern _what_ to build and _how_ to effectively solve problems. In an AI-driven world where countless options can be generated, "taste" is crucial for selecting the right solution, identifying what is truly valuable, and knowing what _not_ to pursue. For example, an AI might generate a thousand marketing slogans, but a human with "taste" will choose the one that resonates most with the target audience and aligns with the brand's identity. Leveraging this involves focusing on critical evaluation and strategic decision-making rather than just generating content.


  * **Extreme Agency** : This refers to the capacity to operate with minimal external direction and to maximize personal ownership. As AI becomes highly efficient at execution, the human role shifts towards setting ambitious goals, defining clear priorities, course-correcting when necessary, and building robust systems. For instance, while an AI might manage project timelines and tasks, a human with extreme agency will initiate a new project, define its scope, and set the overarching vision, guiding the AI's efforts. Leveraging this means embracing leadership, initiative, and proactive problem-solving.


  * **Learning Velocity** : This skill emphasizes the speed at which one can adapt and acquire new knowledge, rather than simply accumulating existing information. Given the rapid obsolescence of technical skills, the ability to learn faster than knowledge itself becomes outdated is paramount. The video notes that current large language models (LLMs) aren't inherently good at learning after their initial release, making this a significant human advantage. Leveraging learning velocity means prioritizing continuous learning, upskilling, and embracing new technologies and methodologies to stay ahead of the curve.


  * **Intent Horizon** : This is the ability to maintain coherent, very long-term goals. While AI can be incredibly helpful for short-term, tactical tasks, it currently struggles with sustained, long-term thinking and continuous memory, often acting "amnesiac" between interactions. Therefore, humans are essential for providing the overarching vision and consistent, long-term direction that AI cannot yet provide. For example, an AI might optimize daily operations, but a human with a strong intent horizon will define the company's five-year strategic plan. Leveraging this involves focusing on strategic planning, vision-setting, and maintaining a clear purpose in the face of short-term distractions.


  * **Interruptibility** : This skill highlights the unique human capacity to be interrupted, seamlessly switch between tasks, and adapt to changing circumstances. In contrast, interrupting most LLM chats is generally considered poor practice and can lead to inconsistent or erroneous results. Humans' inherent flexibility and ability to context-switch are key advantages in dynamic environments. Leveraging this means embracing adaptability, multitasking effectively, and being able to pivot quickly when new information or priorities emerge.


These skills are crucial for navigating what the video terms a "knowledge hyperinflation economy", where knowledge is abundant but good judgment becomes increasingly valuable. The video suggests a shift from a focus on accumulating credentials to developing strong judgment and the ability to discern when AI outputs are incorrect, rigid, or potentially catastrophic.
Remember, learn to use AI well and to help you improve your skillsets and gain real proficiency. Be competitive and do the work.

Reading materials will be authentic and on a variety of subjects, including current events, popular culture, the humanities, and science, to technology, economics, politics, and different cultures. Students should be able to evaluate and critique the reading material as well as use it to develop and expand their vocabularies. In addition, other readings from speech and communication textbooks will be provided.
We may also consider coordinating the reading component to reinforce what has been done in the 
Writing and Reading program as listed below: • Skimming • Scanning • Analyzing structure • Distinguishing mains ideas from details • Telling facts from hypotheses • Making inferences • Introducing critical thinking and analysis • Developing and expanding vocabulary.
