##  課程簡介Course Description
This course provides a rigorous introduction to the fundamental principles of probability theory, with a focus on both theoretical foundations and practical applications. Topics include combinatorics, discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions, expectation, variance, moment generating functions, joint distributions, conditional probability, independence, and limit theorems. Emphasis is placed on analytical reasoning and problem-solving techniques, preparing students for advanced study in statistics, data science, and related fields. The course follows _A First Course in Probability_ by Sheldon Ross, which offers a clear and comprehensive presentation of the subject matter.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course aims to build a solid foundation in probability theory and develop students' ability to model and analyze random phenomena. By the end of the course, students are expected to:
  * Understand the fundamental axioms and principles of probability.
  * Apply combinatorial techniques to compute probabilities in finite sample spaces.
  * Analyze discrete and continuous probability distributions, including Binomial, Poisson, Exponential, and Normal distributions.
  * Calculate expectations, variances, and higher-order moments of random variables.
  * Solve problems involving joint, marginal, and conditional distributions.
  * Evaluate the independence of random variables and apply conditioning techniques.
  * Use moment generating functions to derive distributions and moments.
  * Understand and apply the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.
  * Develop problem-solving skills relevant to real-world uncertainty and randomness.
  * Prepare for further coursework in mathematical statistics, stochastic processes, or machine learning.


Through theoretical exercises and applied examples, students will gain both conceptual understanding and practical proficiency in probability reasoning.
