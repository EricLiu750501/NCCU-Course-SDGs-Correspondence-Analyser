##  課程簡介Course Description
The purpose of this course, _Bond Market Analysis_ , is to provide a comprehensive understanding on the various types of bonds (oftentimes referred to as fixed-income securities) and the function of a bond market (fixed-income securities market). The lecture materials for _Bond Market Analysis_ are based on my 32 years of experience working as a research analyst in the U.S. financial markets. My experience in real estate financing, primary and secondary markets of bonds, and bond credit ratings will provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the process of bond financing. Entities that rely on bonds to finance their activities include: the U.S. Treasury Department, state and local governments, federal government agencies, corporations, and special purpose trusts (for asset securitization).
