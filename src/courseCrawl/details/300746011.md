##  課程簡介Course Description
Course Outline
The course is divided into two modules : career preparedness and essential business communication skills. In the first module, students will begin their career prospecting project by conducting independent research on the fields of professions they are interested in. Students then learn to write and revise a résumé/CV and related job search documents in a panel discussion with the instructor, which is followed by job interview preparation. We will also discuss how to prepare and produce a video CV to promote oneself on the job market, which is gaining in popularity now. In the second module, we focus on essential language skills in formal business meetings and negotiations, which student will apply in an A&M simulation project to negotiate an acquisition or merger proposal based upon research on the parties/entities involved.
