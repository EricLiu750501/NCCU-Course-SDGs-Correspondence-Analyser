##  課程簡介Course Description
Over the past decade, technological innovation has greatly impacted the financial services industry, and further innovation and disruption are occurring every day. We are witnessing major global changes in the realms of foreign exchange, payments, insurance, personal and corporate borrowing, consumer financial advice, and wealth management, just to name a few. Sharing economy has a similar taste and texture. To understand these changes, we need to understand both the technological changes and the underlying economics of the financial services and/or other platform industries, along with the role of Private Equity (PE) and/or Venture Capital (VC) firms that are often funding and fostering such changes, and are affected by them in turn.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
In this course, we will study this innovation and entrepreneurship in the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) services industry in general, with a special focus on Financial Technology (FinTech) and sharing economy. We will examine whether and how the creative application of technology can responsibly address market shortcomings and meet consumer needs in the realm of P2P services. The role of law (including, but not limited to regulation and compliance) will be highlighted and examined in details. In addition, personal identifiable information (PII) plays an ambiguous role in the shaping of New Economy (FinTech included). Hence, related PII laws will be examined from both legal and business perspectives.
We will do so through a combination of cases, lectures, class discussions, and guest speakers, designed to teach students economic principles and put students in the shoes of managers and decision-makers addressing a 'forest' of challenges facing the industry. We will examine innovation in both products and processes in the financial services industry, and explore FinTech or sharing platform as a venue for the application of entrepreneurial thought and venture launch.
