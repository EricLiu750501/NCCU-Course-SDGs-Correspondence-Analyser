##  課程簡介Course Description
This course is the first part of the first-year Master's econometrics sequence. The course covers core topics in modern econometric theory and methods centered on linear regression, including matrix algebra for econometrics and statistics, conditional expectation and projection, the algebra of least squares, least squares regression and normal regression, large sample asymptotics, and asymptotic theory of least squares. Emphasis is placed on building intuition and understand the theoretical foundations to support practical applications. 
Prerequisites include solid undergraduate-level background in linear and matrix algebra, calculus, statistics, and introductory econometrics.
