##  課程簡介Course Description
Cryptography is the science concerned with securing data. This old field emerged from the classical problem to devise methods for exchanging information between two parties in such a way that a third party cannot understand what is said. Early methods had a major drawback, namely, whenever the method was changed, a meeting between the two parties to discuss the new method was necessary. This shortcoming was then subsequently resolved by the invention of new powerful schemes called public key cryptosystems where exchanging keys is not needed anymore. 
In recent years, the development of cryptography has no longer been restricted to the above situation. Cryptography has gradually evolved into a huge field with many applications, e.g., copy right protection, digital signatures, digital cash, electronic voting, etc.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
In this course, students will learn the mathematical tools used in cryptography which are mainly coming from algebra and (algorithmic) number theory. Equipped with these tools, we will then investigate classical public key cryptosystem such as Diffie-Hellman system, RSA, Elliptic Curve Method, etc.
