**Class Attendance** : Class attendance is strongly recommended. Students registered for the course who do not regularly come to class may receive a grade of ND. However, I do not take attendance in a regular basis and the grades are granted based on exams.
**Policy on missed exam** : The dates of the midterm and final exams are fixed. Students who experience a serious medical condition that requires immediate attention from a physician, or an emergency that prevents them from taking the exam may be excused. However, students must contact the instructor **_before_** the exam and must **_verify_** their condition by official documents. No exceptions will be made for job interviews, holiday travel, or other non-academic activities. When a student is properly excused from an exam, no make-up exam will be offered. Instead, his or her course grade will be adjusted based on other exams and homework.
**Policy on Regrading:** If, after reviewing the exam answers, a student feels that there is a grading mistake on his or her exam, that student can submit a re-grade request. The student must submit a written discussion **_within one week_ **from the time at which the exams are handed back. When regrade request is accepted, the entire exam will be regraded, which could lower the score as well.
**Academic Dishonesty:** Cheating hurts our community by undermining academic integrity, creating mistrust, and fostering unfair competition. The university will punish cheaters with failure on an assignment, failure in a course, permanent transcript notation, and/or expulsion. Violations can include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments without permission, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices, unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery, falsification and lying.
