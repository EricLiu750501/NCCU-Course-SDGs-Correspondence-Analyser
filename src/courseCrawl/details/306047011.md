##  課程簡介Course Description
`This course introduces students to the design, development, and management of Information Systems (IS) that support organizational operations and decision-making. Students will learn to integrate people, processes, and technology into cohesive systems that deliver value to both businesses and society.`
`The course covers the fundamental components of MIS, the dynamics of digital markets and strategies, and the principles of information processing and applications. Practical skills are developed through hands-on work in information flow mapping, UI/UX design, database development, and the creation of functional prototypes. Students will also explore the possibilities of innovation applications, leveraging emerging technologies to build systems that address real-world challenges.`
`Throughout the semester, students will work in teams to design, develop, and present a functional prototype of an information system that solves a business or community problem. Each week’s learning activities will build progressively toward the final project, ensuring students gain both the technical skills and strategic perspective needed for an effective, user-centered system.`

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
`This course is designed to equip students with the knowledge, skills, and hands-on experience needed to develop and implement complete MIS. Students will learn to integrate business strategy, user needs, data management, and technology into a cohesive, functional system.`
`By the end of the course, students will be able to:`
  * `Explain what an MIS is and its key components: people, processes, technology, and data.`
  * `Identify user needs and business goals for an information system.`
  * `Plan how information flows through a system.`
  * `Design simple, user-friendly interfaces.`
  * `Develop relational databases to support data storage and management.`
  * `Incorporate innovative technologies (e.g., AI and IoT) to enhance system capabilities.`
  * `Integrate interface design, databases, and data processing into a working prototype.`
  * `Communicate and present system design decisions clearly and effectively.`
`These outcomes are achieved through progressive, project-based learning, where each stage of the course contributes to building a user-centered information system prototype from concept to completion.`
