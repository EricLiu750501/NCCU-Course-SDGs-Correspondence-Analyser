##  課程簡介Course Description
### Statistics is a course about data analysis. This course will begin with a brief overview of the discipline of statistics and will then quickly focus on descriptive statistics, introducing graphical methods of describing data. You will learn the standard and typical probability theorems and random distributions, the latter of which serves as the foundation for statistical inference. Besides we will focus on both estimation and hypothesis testing issues. We will also examine the techniques to study the relationship between two or more variables.
