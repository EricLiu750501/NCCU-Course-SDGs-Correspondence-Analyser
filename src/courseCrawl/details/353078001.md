##  課程簡介Course Description
This course explores the impact of CEO-CFO interplay on corporate investment decisions and firm performance, with a particular focus on the moderating role of locality—specifically, whether the CEO and CFO are local executives. First, this course reviews existing literature on CEO-CFO interplay, examining the respective responsibilities of CEOs and CFOs and how their interactions influence one another. It then investigates how their relationship affects organizational activities, particularly investment decisions and performance outcomes. The course further examines the role of locality in shaping top executives' operational and investment decision-making processes. By incorporating this perspective, we aim to gain deeper insight into how locality may influence the dynamics of CEO-CFO interplay. Ultimately, we assess how locality moderates the relationship between CEO-CFO interplay and corporate investment decisions and performance, aim to provide suggestions for corporate human resource policies.
Given the growing academic interest in CEO-CFO interplay and cooperate focus on the role of locality, this research contributes to the academic understanding of the interplay’s functions and influencing factors. It also provides deeper insights into how these dynamics affect corporate outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to incorporate locality into research on CEO-CFO interplay, making it a significant contribution to both academic literature and practical human resource management.
