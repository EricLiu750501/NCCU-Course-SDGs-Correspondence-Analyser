##  課程簡介Course Description
The latest information is in our class website: https://sites.google.com/view/mikehsiao/teaching/networking-2025
Business Data Communication is a mandatory course exclusively intended for senior students majoring in Management Information Systems. **Only** students majoring in MIS, including those with a double major, are eligible to participate in this course. Students from other departments, IMBA students, and exchange students are kindly requested to unregister from this class.
This course offers an introductory overview of essential principles related to the design and implementation of computer communication networks, protocols, and applications. The topics covered include layered network architecture, the physical layer, data link protocols, network layer design, transport protocols, routing protocols, and network applications. Illustrative examples will be drawn from the Internet TCP/IP protocol suite. Moreover, the course incorporates various programming assignments (previous coding experience is a prerequisite), allowing students to gain practical skills in basic network programming and the development of simple network applications.

Grading
  * Homework (48%): 6 homework.
  * Term Assignment (12%)
  * Midterm and Final (40%)


Grading Policy
  * Accuracy: The primary factor in grading homework is the correctness of the answers or solutions provided. Each question or task is evaluated based on its accuracy and alignment with the given requirements.
  * Completion: The extent to which the homework assignment is fully completed can also impact the grading. Incomplete or partially attempted assignments may receive a lower grade compared to those that are fully finished.
  * Effort and Improvement: In certain cases, instructors may consider the effort put into the assignment or the improvement shown by the student over time. This can be reflected in the grading to acknowledge dedication and progress.
  * Originality and Critical Thinking: Assignments that demonstrate original ideas, creativity, and critical thinking may receive higher grades. This is particularly relevant for open-ended or subjective questions where multiple approaches or interpretations are possible.
