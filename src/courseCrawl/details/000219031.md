##  課程簡介Course Description
This is a one‐year introductory course to economic theory and its applications. In general, economics has two sub-fields: microeconomics and macroeconomics. While microeconomics studies behavior of individual decision makers, households (consumers), and firms (producers) in specific markets, macroeconomics studies aggregate economic behavior (economy‐wide phenomena). Microeconomics and macroeconomics will be covered in the first and second semesters, respectively.
