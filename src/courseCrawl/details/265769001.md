##  課程簡介Course Description
Content
Analysts and academics will encounter a broad range of methods throughout their careers. The more methods they are familiar with, the better they will understand and evaluate others’ work, and the more tools they may apply to their own research. This 1-credit seminar will review four categories of research methods: 
  * experiments, statistics, historical comparative analysis, ethnography
We will also discuss applications of these methods which are popular in dissertation research:
  * conjoint experiments, opinion surveys, media and social media analysis, socioeconomic and political statistics, historical and comparative case studies, interviews
Audience
This course was created with IDAS students in mind. PhD and MA students from other graduate programs are welcome to join.
Pre-requisites
No prerequisites and no prior coding experience are required.
