##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
During the course, students are exposed to a diverse world of ideas and viewpoints about Vietnamese culture, history, and society, some of them could find some ideas and viewpoints new, interesting, yet a bit strange to them. The main purpose of this course is to give students access to new layers of knowledge about Vietnamese culture, history, and society, sometimes far beyond what they have known, so that students can assess others’ interpretations with an open but critical mind. After the course, students will be able to understand: 
  * Basic characteristics of the nature and people of Vietnam;
  * Vietnamese’s traditional cultural values in history as well as in the current process of globalization;
  * Past and present Vietnamese society.


To achieve this, a balanced combined use of lecture, discussion, and student presentation will be used as teaching approach.
