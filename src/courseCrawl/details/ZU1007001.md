##  課程簡介Course Description
_Course Description_
This course offers an introduction to the core concepts and theoretical frameworks of cultural anthropology for undergraduate students. It explores the historical development of anthropological thought, examining how cultural anthropologists have grappled with questions of human difference, similarity, and meaning-making. Students will be introduced to foundational texts—both canonical and contemporary—that reflect the discipline’s evolving concerns and methodologies. Special attention will be paid to the forms of anthropological writing and analysis that shape how cultural knowledge is produced and communicated.
