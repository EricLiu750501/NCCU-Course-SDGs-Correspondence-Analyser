##  課程簡介Course Description
**請務必出席第一堂課確認修課。**
One of the great Japanese management masters, Kenichi Omae, doubted that “Why should teachers know more than students?” This reminds us that opinions of students might contribute to our knowledge accumulation. Thus, in this course, I will pay high attention on student participation and their constructive opinions.
Moreover, some students regard management as academic research, while others regard it as a tool which only managers will use. Neither of them is correct. Actually, management happens frequently in our daily life. One of examples is “time management”. Efficient time management can improve our productivity, which in turn to improve our personal competence. Therefore, another purpose of this course is to encourage students to understand management by applying daily life cases and business cases during the lecture, which might increase their interests on management.
