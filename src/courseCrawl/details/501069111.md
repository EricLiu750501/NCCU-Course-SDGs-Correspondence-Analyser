##  課程簡介Course Description
The course is developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Education's Higher Education Sprout Project (高教深耕計畫). The primary objectives are to (1) enhance students' international competitiveness by promoting engagement in technology-integrated, cross-disciplinary learning; (2) help students focus on the concept of symbiosis between self and other intergroups in Taiwan. Through writing on themes related to these two focuses, extensive reading of cross-disciplinary articles, and the adoption of AI tools for reading and writing assistance, students develop academic writing, critical thinking, and information analysis skills. This enables them to explore contemporary technological issues from a humanities perspective.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
  1. To build students’ confidence in advanced academic English.
  2. To enhance students’ cross-disciplinary academic reading skills and develop their critical reading abilities. Students are expected to gain topic-related vocabulary, reading strategies, and active reading skills.
  3. To gain knowledge of academic writing through various writing tasks. Students will become familiar with academic writing conventions, rhetorical strategies, and various academic writing modes.
  4. To acquire cognitive and metacognitive knowledge in reading, writing, and the use of AI technology, including skills such as problem-solving, decision-making, critical thinking, and autonomous learning.
  5. To develop autonomous learning abilities and digital literacy through reading and writing practices.


Practice
  1. Authentic reading materials will be adopted as the basis of thematic discussions. Reading strategies will not be taught in isolation but will be rooted in theories and practices. The themes for reading and writing can be determined by the students based on their interests.
  2. Students are expected to preview reading materials in advance to participate in group discussions and in-class activities.
  3. The main ideas of the three required writing tasks—Argumentation Essay, Process Essay, and Academic Research Writing—are explained briefly below:


i. Argumentation Essay: Students need to discuss a controversial issue, take a position, analyze the pros and cons, and argue for their positions.
ii. Academic Research Writing: Students are expected to explore and discuss an issue based on first-hand data collected through either interviews or surveys.
  1. Students are required to receive peer feedback from their classmates and AI tools. Writing conferences with the teacher are optional.
  2. Students are required to take learning notes during interactions with AI tools that assist their writing. Their grades for writing will be evaluated based on their chat histories with the AI tools, learning notes, and final writing products.
  3. Through stimulating reading, interactive discussions, autonomous reading, critical research, hands-on data collection practices, and interpersonal collaboration, students are expected to become active learners as well as critical thinkers.
