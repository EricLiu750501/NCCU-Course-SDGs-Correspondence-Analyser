##  課程簡介Course Description
Effective communication requires practice, awareness of social events, and strong willingness to stay informed about everyday life. Building on the communication skills and current topics, this course invites students to critically engage with daily life, literary works, and popular social topics in both English and Chinese. Each week devotes to a specific theme from diverse subjects, such as well-being, parent-child relationship, folk culture, and modern literature. By examining texts from both Western and Eastern writers, students are encouraged to identify shared ideas and explore how these perspectives differ. Be they verbal, written, or audiovisual, these works will not only enhance our ability to communicate effectively in a bilingual scenario, but also spark meaningful reflection on social issues in Taiwan and beyond.
