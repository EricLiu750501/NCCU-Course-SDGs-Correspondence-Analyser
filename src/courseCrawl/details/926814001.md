##  課程簡介Course Description
This interdisciplinary course explores Taiwan’s transformation from a marginal entrepôt trading deer hides to a key player in the global semiconductor industry. Through historical, economic, and technological lenses, it examines how foreign trade, colonial legacies, and global networks shaped Taiwan’s social and economic development. Topics include early maritime trade, Japanese colonial infrastructure, the rise of small and medium-sized enterprises, and Taiwan’s pivotal role in the global tech economy. The course also introduces foundational concepts in the history of science and traces the evolution of modern physics leading to the semiconductor revolution. Field trips and guest lectures enrich the understanding of Taiwan’s dynamic trajectory.
