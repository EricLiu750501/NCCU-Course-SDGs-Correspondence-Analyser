##  課程簡介Course Description
請注意：此門課程將以英語授課，所有的課間報告與討論也將以英文進行。Note: This course will be taught in English. All the in-class presentations and discussions will also be in English.
This seminar course explores advanced theories and research in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Human-AI Interaction (HAI). Students will examine cutting-edge studies and core concepts in the field, including interaction dynamics, social implications, and the evolving roles of robots and AI agents in human environments. Through in-depth discussions and analyses of academic papers, students will critically evaluate the theoretical and empirical foundations of HRI and HAI while considering their applications in diverse contexts. The course also emphasizes understanding how these technologies influence communication, collaboration, and social structures.
