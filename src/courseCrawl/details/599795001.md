##  課程簡介Course Description
Essay Writing is designed to help learners write college-level essays. We will start with a number of essay examples and analysis of their organization, content, lexis, and grammatical structures. As we proceed, learners will become aware of the common criteria and standards for good essays and, moreover, evaluate their own work against these standards. It is hoped that once learners realize the gap between what they are expected to do and what they can do, they will be able to strategically plan their learning and move forward accordingly. After lectures on key concepts, several in-class timed writing exercises and take-home writing assignments are arranged to help learners practice what they have learned. Follow-up discussions of these essays then prepare learners for self-revision to improve the quality of their essays.

**Participation (30%):** Active participation is essential for success in this course. This includes regular attendance and meaningful contributions to the Moodle discussion forum. Students are expected to engage thoughtfully with course materials and peers, demonstrating their understanding and critical thinking skills. Consistent participation will be assessed based on the quality and frequency of your contributions, reflecting your commitment to the learning process and your ability to collaborate effectively with others.
**Essay 1: Classification (10%):** For the classification essay, you will submit both a draft and a revised version. This assignment evaluates your ability to categorize and organize ideas logically. The draft should demonstrate your initial understanding and structuring of the essay, while the revised version should show significant improvement based on feedback. Key expectations include clear classification criteria, coherent structure, and detailed examples. Adherence to language accuracy, appropriate vocabulary, and proper grammar will also be assessed.
**Essay 2: Comparison (10%):** The comparison essay, like the first essay, requires a draft and a revised version. This assignment focuses on your ability to compare and contrast two or more subjects effectively. Your essay should highlight similarities and differences clearly, with well-organized paragraphs and transitions. The revised version should incorporate constructive feedback, showing enhanced analysis and clarity. The use of comparative language, precise vocabulary, and grammatical accuracy will be critical in meeting the expectations for this essay.
**Essay 3: Cause-Effect (10%):** The cause-effect essay assignment involves identifying and explaining the causes and effects of a particular issue or event. You will submit an initial draft and a revised version, with the latter reflecting significant improvements based on instructor feedback. Expectations include a clear thesis statement, logical organization, and detailed explanations of causes and effects. The essay should demonstrate critical thinking, effective use of evidence, and linguistic precision, adhering to standards of coherence, grammar, and vocabulary.
