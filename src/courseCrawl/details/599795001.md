##  課程簡介Course Description
Essay Writing is designed to help learners write college-level essays. We will start with a number of essay examples and analysis of their organization, content, lexis, and grammatical structures. As we proceed, learners will become aware of the common criteria and standards for good essays and, moreover, evaluate their own work against these standards. It is hoped that once learners realize the gap between what they are expected to do and what they can do, they will be able to strategically plan their learning and move forward accordingly. After lectures on key concepts, several in-class timed writing exercises and take-home writing assignments are arranged to help learners practice what they have learned. Follow-up discussions of these essays then prepare learners for self-revision to improve the quality of their essays.
