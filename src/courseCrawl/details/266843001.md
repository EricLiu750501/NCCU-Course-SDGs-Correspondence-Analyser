##  課程簡介Course Description
Technological innovation is profoundly reshaping both economic and military landscapes. Since 2018, the United States and China have been competing for leadership in the next wave of critical and frontier technologies. In recent years, the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, and China itself have all introduced national-level regulations on technology transfer, including export controls and restrictions or screenings on foreign investment. This regulatory shift is not only restructuring the global economy, but also reorganizing technological supply chains and reshaping the broader international order.
Taiwan’s trajectory vividly illustrates this transformation. Over the past four decades, Taiwan has evolved from a peripheral OEM/ODM supplier of ICT components into a central hub of global semiconductor production. Today, Taiwan’s foundry ecosystem is indispensable to AI-driven technological innovation worldwide, marking its transition from the “periphery” to the “core” of the global supply chain—from manufacturing strength to a leading technology powerhouse.
The evolution of semiconductor technology itself lies at the heart of this contest. From the scaling of Moore’s Law to innovations such as heterogeneous integration, advanced packaging, and chiplet architectures, along with the rising demand from high-performance computing and artificial intelligence, breakthroughs in semiconductor technology not only determine industrial competitiveness but also shape national security and the global order. Taiwan has built irreplaceable advantages in advanced process nodes, yield management, and supply-chain collaboration.
Accordingly, this course focuses on the core legal and policy issues arising from the rapid transformation of the geo-technological environment. From an intersectional perspective, it examines: how U.S.–China high-tech competition shapes policy trajectories; the cascading effects of global supply-chain restructuring; and how different national perspectives—including those of Taiwan, the United States, Japan, and Europe—are deploying regulatory tools such as security-related export control reforms, foreign investment reviews, data and information governance, and the protection of intellectual property and trade secrets, collectively forging new governance frameworks and industrial strategies.
