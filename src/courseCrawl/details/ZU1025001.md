##  課程簡介Course Description
We live in a world increasingly unsettled by environmental disasters, political divisions, and rising global violence. This course invites you to reflect: how do civil movements from around the world respond to and challenge systems of oppression? How do they open up new possibilities for living and valuing in everyday life? How might they help us draw closer to a future still worth hoping for—while navigating through the uncertainties of the present?
Through both teacher and student-led inquiries and diverse collaborative engagement, we will examine a range of past and present social movements worldwide. Together, we will explore their underlying ideologies, tactical strategies, and the ways in which they labor—emotionally and politically—to repair the world. This course is not merely a class, but a journey to understand how action and hope intertwine amid disorder and crisis.
我們身處的世界日益動盪，環境災難、政治撕裂與升級的全球暴力方興未艾。我想藉由本課程，邀請你一同思考：來自全球各地的公民運動，如何回應並挑戰系統的壓迫？如何在日常生活中拓展新的生活可能與價值觀？又如何拉近我們與一個仍值得期待的未來間的距離，並在現實的混沌中摸索前行。
在這門課中，我們將透過同學們的自主探索與多元組成，共同認識過去與當前不同社會運動，觀察其背後的思想脈絡、行動策略與修補世界的實踐方式。這不僅是一門課，更是一段試圖理解行動與希望如何在亂世中交織的旅程。
