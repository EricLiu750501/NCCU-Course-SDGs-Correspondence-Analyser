  * Book chapters are assigned each week. Reading each chapter and doing the problems will help you understand the material. I will assume you have read each chapter PRIOR to discussion question and explanation. I am very happy to help any student to learn the material. But before you discuss a question with me, I expect that you do your part of the bargain. That is, you are to read the text, work the problems before hand, and discuss concepts and problems with classmates first. Then you are more than welcome to ask questions anytime! Written Material and your colleagues are valuable resources that are instrumental in any career!!!!
  * Examinations must be taken at the scheduled time. No makeup exam is allowed unless you are involved in an emergency under certain circumstances. If it happens to you, official affidavits and your written petition must be presented to the instructor in order to file for an official decision and record. 


Appropriate classroom behavior is expected at all times, including respect for the instructor and peers. PLEASE make every effort to be in the classroom at the official start time.If circumstances prevent on-time arrival, be considerate of your peers by entering with minimal disruption.Cell phones in the classroom should be turn off during class time! 
The course is comprised of lectures and tutorials. Attendance at lectures and tutorials is compulsory. Students learn from lectures, class discussion, tutorials, and homework exercises, and by preparing other material. Personal study is supplemented by help which is readily available from the instructor and subject tutor. Examinations are part of the learning process. To this end the lecturer and tutor conduct tests in classes.
