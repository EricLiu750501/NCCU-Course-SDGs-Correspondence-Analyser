##  課程簡介Course Description
The primary objective of the course is to review some important theoretical perspectives (theories) in the organizational theory literature. The course is structured to allow students to develop research questions and students are expected to submit one academic paper at the end of this course. 
Class participation: 
The course is set up with a 3-hour lecture each week on Tuesday. Students are expected to prepare referee reports (in PowerPoint format) each week, and each person will be required to present the assigned paper each week. Moreover, one assigned person will be responsible for leading the discussion (including session opening, summarizing the whole papers, and preparing the hardcopy of handouts). 
When reading papers and preparing for your weekly referee reports, students are encouraged to pay attention to the following questions: 
What is the key research question? 
Why is this research question interesting and important? What’s the gap identified?
Are these hypotheses (or propositions) convincing and well-developed? 
Are the context and research designs appropriate for testing these hypotheses?
What are the main findings? Are there any alternative explanations for these findings?
• What limitations does this research have? How can you apply these findings in your term paper or even your own research? 
Readings:
Each week we will cover a set of topics that are important in the organizational theory literature. You will need to read and understand the following papers to participate in class. 
Term paper:
For the term paper, students are expected to conduct a literature review for a theory and develop propositions or testable hypotheses.
