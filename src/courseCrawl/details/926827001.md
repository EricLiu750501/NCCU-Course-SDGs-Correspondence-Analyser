##  課程簡介Course Description
This course will develop students’ knowledge of the major conceptual approaches for policy transfer and lesson learning in policy-making. Students will critically assess and synthesize the applicability of these concepts for analyzing public policy development in Greater China in the context of an increasingly pluralized world. Major public policy areas (for example, environment, social security, or health care) will be compared in light of the global public policy trends and changing governance models in public policy. Students will apply theories and evidence from other countries and reflect on policy transfer processes to Greater China (Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Macau) to enable them to question policy processes, synthesize knowledge from different places and disciplines, and consider the nature of policy in Greater China.
