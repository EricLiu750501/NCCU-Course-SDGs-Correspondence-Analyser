##  課程簡介Course Description
The primary function of theory in the field of International Relations (IR) is to offer a lens through which scholars can investigate and critically analyze events, issues, and even the everyday political dynamics that shape interactions among nations. This course is designed not only to introduce students to the major schools of thought in IR theory and their significance in the evolution of the discipline, but also to demonstrate how these theoretical frameworks can be applied to real-world contexts. Beyond offering a foundation in mainstream IR theories, the course aims to guide students through the development of contemporary international studies, including key debates, emerging trends, and theoretical shifts that have unfolded since the turn of the millennium. More importantly, the course encourages students to cultivate a deeper understanding of the complex global landscape—learning not just to study international affairs, but to approach them with empathy, critical insight, and a commitment to thoughtful analysis. By engaging with diverse perspectives and current global challenges, students are expected to develop the intellectual tools needed to interpret, question, and respond to the world around them in informed and compassionate ways.

|  Role Theory in Foreign Policy Analysis has been the trend in the late 70s and 80s; yet after “disappearing” for decades, in early 2000s, a bunch of North American and European IR scholars returned to this approach and expanded its scope. This week of class focuses on introducing the basic ideas of role theory in FPA and its evolution since the 2000s. |  3 |  24

|  It is said that the IRT is designed for understanding the strong powers’ logics of behaviors. However, the real world of IR is composed mainly by smaller political entities. Scholars of IR began reflecting the unbalanced phenomena of the IR research and calling for more studies on small states’ foreign policy makings. This week’s task is to gain a little flavor of this newly emerged discipline. |  3 |  24

  3. Ibid. Ch.2

  3. Clément Maéva and Eric Sangar. 2018. _Researching Emotions in International Relations: Methodological Perspectives on the Emotional Turn_. Cham: Palgrave Macmillam. Introduction, pp. 1-30.
|  Emotions have been proved to be a crucial component in human decision making process. States did not always follow the traditional ways of action and reaction as suggested by the mainstreams IR theories. Emotions as rhetoric and behaviors are often seen in states or their policy makers’ performances when managing foreign affairs. Emotions could be trigger that shapes and shifts states’ foreign policy making direction in critical moment. This week the focal point of discussion will be the Emotional Turn in IR. |  3 |  24
