##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Students are expected to study how language reflects and shapes mental processes such as categorization, perception, memory, and metaphor. Students will also learn (a) how to analyze linguistic data from a cognitive perspective; and (b) how to critically evaluate empirical studies on language and thought. This class will be conducted in both Mandarin and English. Students will participate in individual or group presentations and discussions based on assigned readings. In addition to weekly engagement, each student is expected to work on a proposed research topic for the final paper, which should incorporate the content and findings of an in-class project.
