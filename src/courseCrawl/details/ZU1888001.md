##  課程簡介Course Description
Since the field of intellectual property management is based on intellectual property law, this course requires extensive weekly study of legal content. _Students without a background in intellectual property law should expect to spend at least ten hours each week on the required readings_. To ensure students have read the assigned materials before class, the course will include occasional quizzes. Since this course emphasizes discussion and critical thinking, _weekly roll calls_ are held to encourage participation. **Please note that students who miss more than three classes will fail the course**.
This course is only open to International College of Innovation (ICI) students. Students from other institutions (including exchange students) should select course number **364765001** , which is offered at the same time and venue as this course.
This course is a study of intellectual property management from the perspective of multinational corporations. Course content includes international intellectual property treaties, major national intellectual property policies, patent management, trademark management, copyright management, trade secret management, intellectual property rights planning, intellectual property sales and licensing, intellectual property financing, and intellectual property valuation.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
The objective of this course is to enable students to understand the basic concepts of intellectual property and to apply them to the transnational innovation and international trade practices of international companies. This course places great emphasis on pre-class reading. Each week there will be assigned readings and cases that students need to study in detail before class. In addition to reviewing the key points of the pre-class readings, the class will focus on discussing on cases. This course will also require students to collect and analyze IP cases in their own country, and report and discuss them in class, so that students can apply the theories they have learned to actual cases.
