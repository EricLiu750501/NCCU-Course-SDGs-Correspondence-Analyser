##  課程簡介Course Description
This course provides an introduction to programming fundamentals and widely used econometric methods using Python—a powerful, open-source language for scientific data analysis. The primary focus is on developing students’ logical reasoning and analytical thinking skills, rather than on programming alone. Hands-on coding exercises during class sessions will help students enhance their logic ability and feel familiar with programming.
The course begins with a basic introduction to Python, including installation and essential functions and methods. It then moves on to data management and analysis using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Seaborn.
