##  課程簡介Course Description
Reliability Analysis is one of the core areas of industrial statistics. It focuses on evaluating the uncertainty of product failure times to mitigate potential hazards caused by failures or establish corresponding maintenance strategies. This course will introduce reliability life testing and provide students with statistical methods to analyze diverse types of reliability data, building a foundational understanding of reliability analysis. Students will learn to apply these techniques using the software R, performing comprehensive data analysis on real data presented in the textbook.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course uses concepts from mathematical statistics to build a theoretical framework for reliability inference. With this foundation, students will be able to develop the techniques needed to analyze various types of real data. However, please note that in the second half of the course, hand calculations and derivations will be required. Make sure you have a good understanding of calculus and matrix operations before taking this course.
