##  課程簡介Course Description
1. Introduce key cultural, social, and political events and phenomena essential to understanding Korea.  
Representative topics include:
**Culture:**
K-Culture: An integrated understanding of food, historical heritage, and the cultural industry.
Unique aspects of Korean social culture: age hierarchy, nunchi (reading the room), etc.
**Society:**
Regionalism
Feminism and meritocracy (especially centered on the MZ generation)
Chaebols and economic inequality
**Politics:**
Democratization
Two presidential impeachments
The conservative shift among the 20s–30s demographic
2. Beyond fragmentary understanding of individual events and phenomena, students will be introduced to foundational theoretical frameworks for integrated analysis of Korean culture, society, and politics. Key frameworks include:
**Confucian order and its pervasive influence across society**
**The modern state and Korea's modernization**
**Structural injustice and modern Korea**
3. Students will deepen their understanding by comparing Korea with either the society they belong to or one they are especially interested in. Comparative analysis will follow the course’s method and be covered in more detail in class.
**Example:** Choose representative cultural, social, or political phenomena from each country, analyze them through appropriate theoretical frameworks, and illustrate why/how the two countries differ.
