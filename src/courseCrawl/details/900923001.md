##  課程簡介Course Description
The course will enable students to develop an understanding of survey research methods and quantitative methods for analyzing international large-scale assessment (ILSA) data. Moreover, the goals of this course are to provide students with the skill sets needed to pose researchable educational questions, locate existing large-scale datasets to answer the questions, understand the data documentation, analyze the existing data appropriately, and communicate the findings in a manner consistent with the standards of the education research community. This course will use the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) as a demonstration. TIMSS provides rich information about the 4th and 8th graders’ mathematics and science achievement achievement and contextual factors, while PISA assesses science, mathematics, and reading literacy with a focus on the particular year.
