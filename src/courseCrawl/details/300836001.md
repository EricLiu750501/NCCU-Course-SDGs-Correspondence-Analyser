##  課程簡介Course Description
A major component of the course involves mastering brand positioning—the art and science of differentiating a brand in a crowded market. Students will examine successful brand positioning strategies and learn how to craft strong, resonant brand identities that capture consumer attention and loyalty.
In addition to building brands, students will also learn to assess and measure brand equity, using key frameworks such as Keller's Customer-Based Brand Equity (CBBE) model. Brand equity measurement will include understanding the strength of consumer-brand relationships, brand associations, and overall market performance. Through this, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of how brands maintain relevance and value over time.
The course is highly practical, with two core project components: brand audits and brand strategy development. In the brand audit project, students will choose a real-world brand to analyze, conducting a thorough review of its performance, market positioning, and consumer perception. The audit will serve as a foundation for the subsequent brand plan, where students will apply their insights to create a strategic and data-driven brand management plan.
Students will not only have a solid understanding of the theoretical aspects of brand management, but they will also be equipped with practical skills to develop and implement effective, long-term brand strategies. This combination of theory and practice will prepare students for future roles in marketing, brand management, or consulting, where strategic brand thinking is essential.
