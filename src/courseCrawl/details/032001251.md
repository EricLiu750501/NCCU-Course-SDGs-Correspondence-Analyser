The grading rubric for the speaking tasks is available on the class website. **Video task (2-3 minutes)** : Choose a book or a movie or simly tell your personal anecdote and give your reflections.

The presentation should be approximately 10-12 minutes. Students will be scored individually based on their ability and preparation; however, part of the presentation marks will be the same for each one in the group.

More details will be announced in class.
