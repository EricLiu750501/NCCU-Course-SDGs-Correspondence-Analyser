##  課程簡介Course Description
College English I/II is a two-semester course, designed to help students improve their English language proficiency, be prepared for learning in a higher education environment in English, and develop the ability to engage critically with the world. While it is a four-skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing) integrated course, a particular emphasis will be placed on speaking and writing skills freshman students tend to lack most. All College English I/II courses are conducted in English.  
Students will be exposed to a wide variety of knowledge areas and are expected to use the English language to interact with others, absorb information, and examine their own thinking. It is hoped that through the vehicle of English language, students are able to, not only sharpen their language skills, but also develop their interpersonal skills and thinking styles that are essential to their university studies.
Themes involving university life, self-awareness, language and literature, science and technology, health and environmental issues, and other current issues are all among the topics of interest. Class activities, in either a classroom or a language lab, will be provided in as many different formats as possible, including but not limited to, lectures, pair-work, group discussions, debates, role-plays, and group presentations.
