##  課程簡介Course Description
Informetrics is not an easy subject to cover in a course because:   
(a)the literature is vast;   
(b)much of it is theoretical or speculative based on a minimum of empirical evidence;   
(c)there seems to be much conflicting evidence.   
This course attempts to broaden an overview of the subject touching upon all important areas; hopefully this will encourage some of you to pursue certain areas in more detail through further reading and/or your own research. Informetrics by definition is a quantitative field. However this course is not going to get into the purely mathematical aspects.
