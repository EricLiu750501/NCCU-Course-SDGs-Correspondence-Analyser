##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course is designed to provide you with an in-depth understanding of the subject covered by the materials - fundamental financial accounting. The nature of this course is demanding and challenging. It is time-consuming for a college freshman to master the subject while trying to get used to the newly-started college life in the same time. To succeed, you need to put serious efforts outside of class. Come to each class prepared.
The course materials are presented through a mix of pre-recorded class lectures, assigned readings and problems. You should maximize your understanding of the materials by watching class lectures. To be successful, you are expected to actively involve in the course by asking questions via email and review the assigned readings and attempt all homework problems after the class.
