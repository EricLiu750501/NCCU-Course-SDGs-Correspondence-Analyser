**請注意：此門課程將以英語授課，所有的課間報告與討論也將以英文進行。****Note: This course will be taught in English. All the in-class presentations and discussions will also be in English.**
This seminar course explores advanced theories and research in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Human-AI Interaction (HAI). Students will examine cutting-edge studies and core concepts in the field, including interaction dynamics, social implications, and the evolving roles of robots and AI agents in human environments. Through in-depth discussions and analyses of academic papers, students will critically evaluate the theoretical and empirical foundations of HRI and HAI while considering their applications in diverse contexts. The course also emphasizes understanding how these technologies influence communication, collaboration, and social structures.

* This syllabus is developed with reference to Professor Malte Jung's courses at Cornell University (USA): Robots, Teamwork, Emotion.
* Due to the rapid development of AI technologies, assigned readings are subject to change. Students may propose substitutions or opt out of readings during their assigned weeks. Final details will be discussed in Week 1.
* This course also includes 6 hours of online reading of recently published papers and submitting reflection reports on the Moodle platform. Detailed instructions will be provided in the first week.

##  評量工具與策略、評分標準成效Evaluation Criteria
**The total score of 100 points will be the accumulation of these activities:**
  * **Leading a class (20%)****:** Each student will lead one class over the course of the semester. (Students may form a team to co-lead. I will decide the size of the teams in the first week.) The class lead(s) will be responsible for the assigned readings and, if preferred, selecting 1-2 additional articles for students to read that apply concepts from that week’s readings to current work in Human-AI Interaction (HAII), Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Computer-mediated communication (CMC), human-computer interaction (HCI), or a related area. Readings must be assigned to the rest of the class a week in advance. During the class session, the student(s) will be the class lead(s) to lead the discussion. The class lead(s) are encouraged to include multiple activities and up-to-date examples (such as short videos, memes, recent popular SNS posts, other student’s online discussion) to facilitate the discussion.  

  * **Online Discussion (15%)****:** Each week (except for Week 1, team project presentation, team project data collection, and final poster sessions), students are expected to post comments on the topic in the online forum set up for that week.


  
Each post should include (a) a short description of one surprising or interesting point from the readings assigned for that week, something you did not know before or had not thought deeply about; and (b) some implications of this interesting point for your own research or experience. Posts should be about 150-300 words and must be completed by 6 PM one day before the class to receive credit.  
  
Students should also comment on two other student's posts by 10 PM one day before the class to receive full credit.  
  
Each student is allowed to miss two weeks without any need for explanation, but no late submission will be accepted. If a student misses more than two assignments, no excuses will be accepted for subsequent missed assignments.  

  * **Team Research Projects (55%)****: Students will work in teams to conduct a research project on an HRI or HAII topic. This project can be design-oriented, theoretical analysis, or related to human’s behavior related to intelligent agents.**  
  
Students are expected to work on:  

    * **Idea Pitch (5%):** Students will prepare 2-3 research topics, why they find these topics interesting and important, supported by key previous studies (2-4 for each topic). Every research topic should be less than 1 page, double spaced, excluding tables and figures.


  *     * **Midterm Research Proposal Presentation (15%):** Students will present (1) one chosen research topic, (2) a refined introduction of research motivation supported by a brief literature review (with clear definitions of the main concepts, and at least 4 relevant studies), and (3) proposed research methods. The presentation should be between 8-12 minutes, followed by 5 minutes of Q&A.  

    * **Final Poster Session (15%):** Each research project team will present its research and results to the class via a short oral presentation and a poster. Students also need to prepare a 1-2 minute of short video and upload it onto YouTube to attract attention to their research. Further details will be provided later in the semester.  

    * **Final Report (20%):** Students will write a report of the project using standard report-writing style (e.g., introduction, related work (literature review), hypotheses, method, results, discussion). The research report should be 10-15 pages, double spaced, excluding tables and figures.


  * **Class participation (10%)****:**
**Active participation is essential for this course.** Students are expected to come to each class prepared, having read and taken notes on the assigned materials. You may be called on to summarize the main arguments, strengths, weaknesses, or critiques of any assigned reading.
**To receive full participation credit, each student must contribute verbally at least twice per class session. Simply attending class without speaking will result in zero points for participation that day.**
Each student may miss **up to two classes** without explanation. However, **no additional absences will be excused** , regardless of the reason. In addition, students must not miss the class sessions during which they are responsible for leading discussions, presenting team projects, collecting data, or participating in the final poster session.
  * **Bonus (2%)****:** Participating in any user studies related to communication, design, psychology, and human-computer interaction at NCCU will lead to +0.5 of the final semester points. Students can participate in up to 4 studies. (If a study takes more than 30 minutes, it counts as 2 studies.)
