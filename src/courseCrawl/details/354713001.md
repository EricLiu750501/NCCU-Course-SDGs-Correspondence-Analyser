##  課程簡介Course Description
Network data analysis has become a central topic in statistical machine learning, with a primary focus on understanding the dependence structure among variables. Such techniques have been widely applied in genomic studies, bioinformatics, and social networks. This course focuses on the analysis of graphical models and introduces several complex data structures relevant to modern applications. Designed for PhD students, the course provides a solid foundation in graphical models along with contemporary techniques for analyzing high-dimensional and structured data.
