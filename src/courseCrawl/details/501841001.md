##  課程簡介Course Description
**Course Description****課程簡介**
This course introduces the basic aspects of linguistic meaning in human communication. It aims to give students access to some of the central ideas in the field of semantics so that students can gain a feel for what doing semantics is like. It seeks to give students a deeper insight into the nature of grammar and into the cognitive principles that motivate its structure so that students learn to see the study of language as a fascinating and challenging field of human experience. Topics will include studies of meaning, dimensions/scopes of meaning, lexical relations, things (reference and sense, quantifiers, and modifiers), deixis, predicates and participants, and situations as temporal units (aspect, tense, and modality).
