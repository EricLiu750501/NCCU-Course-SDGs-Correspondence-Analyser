##  課程簡介Course Description
Since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the complex planning of multinational enterprises in the area of tax has caught much attention of the societies around the world. In addition, the events surrounding Panama Papers and Paradise Papers have also caused many governments to attempt to address the enforcement issues for foreign related tax matters.  
This course aims to examine the various ways in which various jurisdictions tax individual persons and legal persons on their activities both within and beyond their borders. This course introduces the basic structure of international tax law and its foundational concepts, and prepares students to do research on the contemporary topics, including the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of the United States, and the ongoing efforts by more than 130 jurisdictions to realize their two-pillar deal, including the so-called "global minimum tax," reached in October 2021.
English is the medium of instruction for this course.
