##  課程簡介Course Description
This course teaches students how to complete a research design and basic research methods, including both qualitative and quantitative methods. We will discuss the process of writing a research proposal and cover issues such as framing your research question, collecting data, and analyzing and interpreting data. In addition to introducing widely-used qualitative and quantitative methods in social sciences and international studies, this course will focus on how to practically answer your research questions using different qualitative or quantitative methods. 
This course is divided into two parts. Before the mid-term exam, our focus is on quantitative methodology, and every week we will have a one-hour R section in which you will use statistical software R to finish some tasks and analyze data. After the mid-term exam, we will focus on qualitative methodology and cover a number of methods. From Week 2 onwards, you will be given homework to work on every other week, and are expected to submit your answers to the Moodle by the next class (i.e., 9:10am on Friday). Late submissions will not be accepted. There will be a total of five homework throughout the semester. At the end of the semester, you also need to complete a research proposal no longer than 4,000 words and present it in class. The paper is due on _December 19th, 5pm_ , to the Moodle.
