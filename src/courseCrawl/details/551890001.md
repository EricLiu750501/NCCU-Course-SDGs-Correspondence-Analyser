##  課程簡介Course Description
Walter Benjamin is an ingenious German-Jewish philosopher and a versatile intellectual whose counter-intuitive investigations into Western modernity have acquired full weight in the contemporary literary and cultural studies. Among his works, _The Arcades Project_ (_Das Passagenwerk_) stands out as the most arcane tour de force. Published posthumously as a hotchpotch of notes which he had been laboriously collecting and meticulously filing, _The Arcades Project_ provides a rigorous mapping of Western modernity and gestures towards the labyrinthine passageways which, if followed with care, might lead us out of the tight grip of nascent fascism. Among the variously topics Benjamin touches upon in this daunting project, this seminar will focus on Benjamin's critical rethinking of art (Baroque and avant-gardist),literature (particularly Baudelaire and Kafka), architecture (Paul Scheerbart Le Corbusier and modern functionalism) and technology (especially the newfound cinematic reproducibility), with a view to appreciating its relevance to our on-going negotiation with Western modernity and its ideological twin--the emergent late fascism. In order to demonstrate the continued validity of _The Arcade Project_ and its potential contribution to literary studies, this course will throw in for good measure Giorgio Agamben's  _State of Exception_ and Percival Everett's  _James_ in the final five sessions.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
From 1927 until 1940, during the thirteen years leading up to Walter Benjamin’s suicide, the  _Arcade Project_ was the intellectual endeavor that this Weimar-era thinker was deeply committed to completing. Especially after 1934, when Benjamin chose to go into exile in Paris to escape the Nazis, his urgent desire to make a breakthrough in  _The Arcade Project_ became even more apparent. Benjamin regarded  _The Arcade Project_ as his most pressing intellectual work during this period, a perspective closely tied to the historical context he lived through.
During these thirteen years, liberalism steadily declined following the failure of the 1918 German Revolution. Communism, rather than sustaining liberalism’s legacy, was overshadowed by the rise of Stalinism, which, under the banner of the “collective,” increasingly curtailed individual intellectual space. Consequently, after the Nazis came to power, the weakened ideologies of liberalism and communism clearly could not serve as intellectual counterweights to fascism.
In Germany and Europe, where fascism was steadily ascending to hegemonic dominance, the critical question was how to conceptualize and write in order to break free from the shadow cast by far-right extremism. This question was precisely what Benjamin spent thirteen years attempting to explore and address through  _The Arcade Project_ — an intellectual escape route sought through his work.
Today, in the twenty-first century, with communism, neoliberalism, and neo-conservatism being reduced to historical ashes consecutively, the situation of far-right ideological supremacy brought about by the dominance of "late fascism" bears a striking resemblance to the Europe Benjamin inhabited eight or nine decades ago. Beyond guiding students to understand the core intellectual work of  _The Arcade Project_ , this course also aims to explore what enduring insights it can offer to us in the present.
