##  課程簡介Course Description
This post-graduate course will examine the evolving security dynamics of the Asia-Pacific region, integrating both traditional (military, strategic) and non-traditional (economic, cyber, environmental, societal) dimensions of security. This course aims to introduce students to concepts and issues that constitute the agenda of security. It highlights different approaches to understand the security issues; and the key ongoing drivers and transitions. Various theoretical and historical debates on what are considered "classical" security concepts in the 21st century are reviewed and discussed, such as geo-political rivalry, Great Power competition and War. In addition, this course enables students to understand non-traditional security issues such as cyber security, climate change and terrorism etc. 
The course is framed by recent developments including:
  * Escalating tensions in the South China Sea, where China’s intensive maritime posture and U.S.-Philippines naval cooperation have reshaped regional deterrence.
  * Heightened cross-Strait instability, marked by Chinese PLA encirclement exercises in the Taiwan Strait.
  * The resurgence of the U.S.-China trade war, with President Trump’s 2025 tariff targeting key Asian economies and triggering global economic reverberations.
  * ASEAN’s security and its internal divisions, where efforts to finalize a binding Code of Conduct stalled amid geopolitical fragmentation.
Students will analyze the strategic behavior of key actors: China, the United States, Taiwan, Japan, Korean Peninsula, ASEAN, India, within this rapidly shifting landscape. Taiwan’s defense transformation and international partnerships will receive special focus, alongside emerging concepts such as gray-zone warfare, hybrid threats, strategic ambiguity, and economic statecraft. Several guest lecturs by international security scholars/experts will be arranged to enhance the diversity of class.
The course will blend recent security situations and postures in the Asia Pacific region, academic theory with applied policy analysis, offering guest lectures, tabletop exercises, and field trip/visit to foster professional development and real-world engagement.
