##  課程簡介Course Description
Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, widely used across industries and platforms. According to IEEE Spectrum’s 2024 report (https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2024), it ranks number one across major tech communities like GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Google. Its popularity comes from its clean and easy-to-read syntax, making it perfect for beginners and powerful enough for professionals.
In this course, you will learn how to use Python to automate tasks, analyze data, and build simple applications. For example, you will write programs that search for keywords online, count button clicks, or organize large sets of information. As your skills grow, you will see how Python can support real-world innovations, such as helping cars drive safely or reconnecting people through data.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
There are three main goals for this course. Firstly, we aim to cultivate Pythonistas who possess fundamental knowledge of Python, have a strong interest in the language, and can effectively solve problems by leveraging Python's capabilities. Secondly, we want to encourage participants to continue their learning journey in the International College of Innovation (ICI) by enrolling in courses such as Data Science, Introduction to AI, and AI Ethics. Lastly, as this course is in collaboration with the Election Study Center (ESC), we will introduce valuable Python packages that students can utilize to develop skills relevant to Python application, equipping them to face future challenges effectively.
