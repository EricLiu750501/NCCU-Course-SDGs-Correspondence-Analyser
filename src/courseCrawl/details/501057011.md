##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
**_Oral Training Goals:_**
The goal for the first semester is to acclimate students to the use of English as a communicative tool. First, students should be comfortable speaking in English in extended informal settings. Then they should be able to recognize, respond and converse with the appropriate degree of formality when interacting in social contexts which require varying levels of formality. Next, students can be placed in situations where English is needed to successfully accomplish a task. Students should be able to informally present their decisions upon completing the task. Finally, students should be comfortable speaking in front of an audience and should be give simple directions, express opinions, and finally be able to make impromptu speeches in front of the whole class. We will integrate AI into this course, and we will discuss the ethical uses of AI. Students will learn about creating an AI chatbuddy to use outside of class, and are expected to use AI as an additional resource to independently improve their English proficiency. 
By the end of the semester students should feel comfortable and confident in using English in daily informal conversation. They should now be able to communicate in more structured and formal situations. When they encounter topics that they are unfamiliar with, they should be able to use English to fill in gaps in their knowledge.
