##  課程簡介Course Description
21st Century education needs to prepare students for a knowledge society in which knowledge creation and collaboration is critical. The purpose of this course is to address these important challenges based on the latest research on knowledge creation and new learning designs supported by cutting-edge technologies. As described in a UNESCO report titled Towards Knowledge Societies, “The magnitude of technological change, which over recent decades has affected the means of knowledge creation, transmission and processing, have brought a number of experts to hypothesize that we stand on the threshold of a new era of knowledge" (p.47). In response to this social and technological change, esp. in an AI era, many scholars have pointed out that the kind of learning competences and knowledge skills needed for preparing students to enter knowledge societies has also been under great transformation. For example, as identified from a number of studies that examine future workplace skills (e.g., U.S. Dept. of Labor), scholars have argued that the most essential knowledge-age survival skills by future knowledge workers are the following 7Cs: (1) critical thinking-and-doing, (2) creativity, (3) collaboration & community-building, (4) cross-cultural understanding, (5) communication, (6) computing, and (7) career and learning self-reliance, managing change, and lifelong learning. Accordingly, new ways of teaching and learning are required in order to help students develop such skills. The question is “How?” The purpose of this course is to offer a possibility—i.e., knowledge-building principles—and to explore its potentials and limitations in preparing students for entering into knowledge societies to become knowledge workers and, at the same time, to understand the role of learning technology such as ChatGPT in facilitating this process of educational transformation.
