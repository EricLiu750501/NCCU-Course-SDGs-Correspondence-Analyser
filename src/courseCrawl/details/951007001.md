##  課程簡介Course Description
(This is just a tentative and sketchy course outline. A more thorough syllabus will be presented to all class members on the first day of class.)
This course aims to help all the participants (TESOL graduate students) develop an updated and critical understanding of language teaching theories. These are five main themes:
1. Foundations of Methodology
2. Language Skills
3. Skills for teachers
4. Integrated approaches
5. Focus on the learner
6. Focus on the teacher
We will use two books and supplemented with research papers on related concepts. It is also important for us to spend a substantial amount of time critically thinking about and discussing how these Western theories and concepts can be used to examine local issues.
