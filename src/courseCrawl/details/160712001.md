##  課程簡介Course Description
How do we really mean what we say—and how can we teach that to language learners? This course explores the intricate relationship between context and meaning in communication, focusing on how pragmatic concepts can be applied to second language acquisition (SLA) and English language teaching. Students will explore key topics such as speech acts, implicature, presupposition, Grice' s Cooperative Principle, politeness strategies, and information packaging (e.g., topic-focus structure and given-new distinctions). Blending theory with practice, the course equips future language educators with the tools to recognize and teach the often-unspoken rules of real-world language use in diverse classroom settings.
