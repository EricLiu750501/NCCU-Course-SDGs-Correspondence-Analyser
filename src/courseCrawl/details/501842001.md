##  課程簡介Course Description
**This course, offered to undergraduate students, introduces those narratives that cope with certain traumatic pasts haunting the characters and explores how the unspeakable psychic wounds are represented in the fictional texts as the manifestation of repressed individual and collective memory. The focus will be placed mainly on the Anglo-American trauma narratives, including works by Katherine Anne Porter, Cynthia Ozick, Tim O’Brien, Michael Chabon etc., and the representation of historical traumas which can be traced back to American slavery. The issue of racial identity will also be covered given that collective trauma shapes the historical memory of an ethnic group. Students are encouraged to infuse Chinese literary works and/or cultural experiences in Taiwan into their reading and discussions.**
