##  評量工具與策略、評分標準成效Evaluation Criteria
Class time will be devoted to activities that allow you to practice and interact in English. To successfully complete the course, you must prepare the assigned homework prior to class and, while in class actively participate in class discussions and pair/group work. Your final grades are determined by the following course components:
  * Participation (including attendance and Moodle discussion): 15%
  * Speaking exams 10%+20% = 30%
  * Written assignments: 30%
  * Final written exam: 25%


**Participation**
Your participation grade will be based on your attendance, homework preparation, and the contribution you make to the learning experience of others, such as your posts on Moodle discussion forums. Contribution includes your in-class questions to the instructor, insights and comments regarding class content, answers to the instructor's questions, and reactions to other students' contributions.
**Written assignments**
There will be three major written assignments in addition to in-class and take-home writing exercises. In each assignment, you will respond to writing prompts about a cultural issue using the writing skills you learned in class. Your paper should demonstrate that you have thought seriously and critically about the topic and made effective use of the resources provided. You are also encouraged to research the topic and cite your sources. The grading rubric for the written assignments is available on the class website.
**Examinations**
All materials, including the readings, handouts, and information provided in class will potentially be included in the final written exam. The two speaking tests require you to answer two or more questions, each question for at least one minute. The instructor will evaluate your ability to respond to the questions appropriately and to speak for an extended period of time without hesitation, deviation or repetition. The grading rubric for the speaking test is available on the class website. Exams can NOT be made up or rescheduled unless you provide documentation of a true emergency.
