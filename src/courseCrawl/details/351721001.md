##  課程簡介Course Description
Business combinations are a critical part of the fabric of doing business in a free market economy both within a country and across political boundaries. Because business combinations often entail a common set of activities, the manager or analyst is able to view mergers, acquisitions, or business alliances in the context of a process or logical sequence of activities. This course is intended to help the students think of all the activities that contribute to the success or failure of mergers, acquisitions, and business alliances in an integrated way. The process outlined in this course consists of 10 interrelated phases and is sufficiently flexible to be applicable to business of various sizes and in different industries. Another part of the course presents a comprehensive approach to corporate valuation. It treats in detail the valuation of mergers, acquisitions, and leveraged buyouts, and the assessment of asset restructuring options and recapitalization plans. It contains valuation procedures and examples for the different types of transactions and contractual arrangement commonly encountered in practice. This course is designed for the graduate students with an interest in M&As, business alliances, and other forms of corporate restructuring.
