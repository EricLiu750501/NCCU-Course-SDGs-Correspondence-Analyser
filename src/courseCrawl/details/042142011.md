##  課程簡介Course Description
It is common for people around the world to hear the expression “we live in a globalized world.” Nonetheless, few students get to realize the true extent of globalization and global developments in our daily lives. Similarly, being this a core general education course, it is relevant to understand how globalization affects our different disciplines of study and poses opportunities and challenges for our future professional decisions and careers. 
This course is designed for students from different departments in our university to approach the topic of globalization using multiple theoretical and empirical instruments. Usually, people tend to associate globalization with economic affairs, mostly thinking about trade and investment. However, other types of globalization also need to be appreciated and discussed, which renders our understanding of human interactions and international relations more comprehensive. From the cultural, political and social spheres, we will also approach the different impacts of globalization in our lives, and try to understand the world that revolves around us.
