##  課程簡介Course Description
The Economics of Human Capital is a one-semester course at the senior-undergraduate or graduate level that offers a comprehensive examination of human capital accumulation. Topics include population dynamics, education and training, labor migration, entrepreneurship, nutrition and health, and gender. The course investigates the role of human capital in economic development by analyzing its properties and channels of accumulation through both theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence, with particular emphasis on economic reasoning and interpretation. Upon completion, students will understand the essence of human capital, its distinction from traditional physical capital, and its influence on labor market performance—both in terms of efficiency and equity—as well as on macroeconomic growth. Finally, the course addresses the effects of globalization and digitalization on human capital accumulation and income inequality.
