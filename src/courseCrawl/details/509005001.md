##  課程簡介Course Description
This course aims to introduce German at a beginners level. Guided by a native speaker students will gain firsthand experience in communicating in the German language as well as a basic view onto the German culture. Students will practice content-orientated short dialogues for everyday situations with study partners or groups and present them in class. The teacher’s correction of the students’ performance will improve their ability to speak and understand short simple German sentences at the beginners level.
NCCU encourages students to gain self-learning experiences. Students should use additional materials, e.g., visiting the NCCU e-moodle platform, DW Deutsche Welle online learning courses, etc.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
The goal of this course is to enable students to communicate successfully in simple German on a basic level (i.e. Common European Framework of Reference for Languages level A1). German vocabulary and pronunciation will be introduced. This will help the students’ ability to talk and to understand simple German sentences. Students will learn how to talk in simple standard German and practice exchanging uncomplicated information. 
Weekly homework assignments including previewing the lesson and revising their assignments will be required. Students will work in groups or with study partners. After each chapter an oral test mostly in form of a free-spoken dialogue in German will be given. Each student’s absentee hours must be under 25% of the total scheduled classroom hours; otherwise the student’s results cannot be accepted.

##  評量工具與策略、評分標準成效Evaluation Criteria
NCCU encourages students to gain self-learning experiences.
The teaching approach consists of ca. 60 % lecture and ca. 40% students' learning partner or group activity.
The final grade of the semester will be derived from:
(a) 30%: oral contribution, rarely written homework, and oral tests (i.e. oral tests after each learned chapter) 
(b) 30%: the oral mid semester test 
(c) 40%: the oral final examination.
Students are not allowed to use mobile phones while playing dialogues and presenting projects that are graded homework. However, in class, working with learning partners, they can use mobile phones as tools for translation.
同學在課堂上進行對話和上台報告時不得使用手機。然而，與學習夥伴一起相關活動時，則可以使用手機作為翻譯工具。
##  指定/參考書目Textbook & References
The new textbook “Schritte international Neu, A1.1” (Max Hueber Verlag) with the included workbook will be required for the class. 
An additional glossary would be very useful for the students. The workbook CDs that accompany the textbook are highly recommended for practice outside of classroom hours. Furthermore every student needs a dictionary (for instance “Deutsch-Chinesisch Chinesisch-Deutsch. Handwörterbuch zum praktischen Gebrauch”).
