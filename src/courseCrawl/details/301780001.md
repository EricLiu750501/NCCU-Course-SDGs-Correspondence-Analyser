##  課程簡介Course Description
Negotiation has been defined as the art of letting the other person have it your way! Can you get the deal you want whilst making your opponent feel the same? 
This course is composed of 8 modules which provide a wide spectrum of coverage for those who seek excellence in both negotiation skills as well as in business English skills. 
What is the worst thing you can do to a negotiator? What does grammar have to do with business etiquette of diplomacy? What is the difference between negotiating positions and interests? And what are the six principles of persuasion you should follow to make any negotiator much more likely to say yes? 
You will discover the answers to these and many other questions about international negotiations by taking part in some challenging role plays and skill-building games, and by practicing the art of asking probing questions and of disagreeing without being too direct. 
In this course you will know when to take the lead and when to wait and see what the other side offers first. You will also learn how to decode typical body language signals, defend yourself against unethical tactics and boost your own persuasiveness. 
Meanwhile, the issue of cultural differences will be raised as well to bring up learners’ awareness on how other cultures may have an impact on their approaches to international business situations.
