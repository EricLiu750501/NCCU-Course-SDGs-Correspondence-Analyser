##  課程簡介Course Description
As the demand for robust cloud computing, scalable data warehousing, and advanced analytics solutions continues to grow, this course provides a comprehensive journey through the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) ecosystem. Students will begin by mastering the fundamentals of cloud infrastructure, including Compute Engine (VMs) and Kubernetes (GKE), thereby establishing a solid foundation in cloud-based computation and container orchestration.
From there, the course transitions into real-time messaging with Pub/Sub and data processing pipelines using Dataflow and Dataproc, enabling students to manage both streaming and batch data at scale. Learners will then explore BigQuery, GCP's serverless enterprise data warehouse, gaining skills in data management, SQL analytics, and performance tuning.
The curriculum also covers BigQuery ML, where students will develop and deploy machine learning models directly within BigQuery using SQL, bridging the gap between analytics and predictive modeling. Additional topics include Spanner for globally consistent relational databases, Bigtable for large-scale NoSQL workloads, and BigLake for unified data lake analysis. To visualize and communicate insights, students will use Looker Studio to create interactive dashboards and reports. Finally, learners will explore the integration of Gemini, Google's advanced multimodal AI model, applying generative AI capabilities to data analysis, application development, and business intelligence.
