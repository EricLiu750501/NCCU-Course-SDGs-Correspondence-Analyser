##  評量工具與策略、評分標準成效Evaluation Criteria
**In-class activities (48%):** Every class session includes a graded component, such as quizzes on the assigned readings, in-class writing, and small group activities, each worth 4% of your grade. Your top 12 of these will count toward your grade. This allows up to three missed classes with no penalty, as _make-ups will not be offered_. Please bring a device or notebook for in-class activities.
The goal of in-class activities is to help you engage thoughtfully with course materials. Your original ideas and reflections are what matter. Therefore, _the use of AI tools is strictly prohibited in in-class activities._
_Academic Integrity Notice_ : Any compromise of integrity in in-class activities (e.g., using AI tools, submitting responses from outside the classroom) will result in a zero for the entire 48% portion of your final grade.
**Final project (52% combined):** The final project allows you to explore a topic relevant to the course materials, focusing on a specific phenomenon at the intersection of language and society. You may choose to conduct a literature review or a small-scale empirical study. There are three graded components of the final project: proposal (2%), oral presentation (20%), and written report (30%). 
**Proposal (2%):** Submit a 1-paragraph proposal in Week 10 identifying your topic and goals. Sign up for your oral presentation date at the same time.
**Oral presentation (20%)** : Present your project to the class during Weeks 12–15. Presentation time will depend on the size of the class.
**Final project (30%):** Incorporate feedback from your presentation and submit a polished final report in Week 16. _No late submissions will be accepted._ You may use AI tools to assist your writing (e.g., for grammar checking or organization), but you must disclose what tools were used and how.
_Academic Integrity Notice_ : Any misuse of AI (e.g., generating fake references or content) or plagiarism will result in a zero for the entire 30% of your grade.
