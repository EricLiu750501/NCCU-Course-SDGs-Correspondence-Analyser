##  課程簡介Course Description
Sustainable development has been ardently advocated by numerous international institutions, governments, NGOs, and corporations in recent years. Despite its growing prominence, the concept of sustainable development is broad and complex. One illustrative example of its scope is the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These cover a wide array of interconnected objectives, ranging from poverty eradication and climate action, to ensuring inclusive education and beyond.
Navigating these multifaceted and often nebulous concepts can pose a significant challenge. The tasks of defining these goals, assessing progress, and crafting effective strategies are no small feats. Yet, the advent of advanced data analysis tools and techniques provides a promising pathway to address these complex issues.
