##  課程簡介Course Description
TL;DR. Learn how to make smarter, evidence‑based decisions about real‑world spatial problems.  
We start with core decision‑making tools, then dive into GIS, spatial analysis, and machine learning to tackle challenges like planning infrastructure, mapping hazards, and shaping land‑use policy. By the end, we will be able to design, run, and evaluate powerful spatial decision workflows from the ground up.
Long Version.
How can we make better decisions about places, spaces, and the world around us?  
This course explores the tools and approaches that help answer that question.
It begins with the basics of decision-making — breaking down complex choices into manageable steps and comparing options in a structured way. Core methods such as _multi‑criteria analysis, weighting techniques,_ and _simple statistical models_ provide a foundation for understanding robust decision processes.
During the second half of the semester, the focus then shifts to _spatial problems_ — those that involve geography and location. Using _Geographic Information Systems (GIS),_ the class works through real-world challenges including site selection, infrastructure planning, hazard zone mapping, and land-use policy evaluation. Hands-on labs demonstrate how _Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS)_ are designed, adapted, and assessed for different decision contexts.
The course introduces _machine learning_ approaches — including _decision trees, logistic regression,_ and _clustering_ — to identify patterns in decision-making. Spatial machine learning models and feature ranking strategies add a leading‑edge complement to traditional analysis.
By the end of the semester, we will have the skills to:
  * Apply GIS and integrated tools to address spatial decision problems,
  * Design and implement complete decision‑making workflows,
  * Evaluate the robustness and reliability of decision processes.
Relevant to fields such as _urban planning, environmental analysis, disaster management,_ and _policy design,_ the course equips students with a practical toolkit for evidence‑based spatial decision making.

##  每周課程進度與作業要求 Course Schedule & Requirements
About This Schedule  
The semester is structured in two parts.  
The first half builds a strong foundation in decision theory — moving from certainty and uncertainty into multi‑criteria decision‑making (MCDM) methods, weighting criteria, advanced approaches, and robustness testing.  
The second half applies those concepts to spatial decision-making, introducing GIS, data integration, spatial modeling, workflow design, and an applied real‑world project.
Classes take place in the GIS lab (270610) for 3 hours per session. The hybrid format integrates theory and hands-on practice, supporting learners of varied backgrounds. All course content is in English; while prior experience with GIS and spatial data is helpful, curiosity and an analytical mindset are the most valuable prerequisites.
