##  課程簡介Course Description
In an era bombarded with notifications and overwhelmed by information, the media not only fragments our focus but fundamentally reshapes the way we access knowledge today. Building on the media literacy foundation, this course looks into the mechanism of media outlets, asking these key essential questions: _What is the media?_ _In what way does the media transform our daily interactions, and what do we sacrifice for its convenience and allure?_ From printed words to digital platforms, the dissemination of information has undergone a sea change. Televisions, smartphones, and live-streaming services offer lavish entertainment and immediate connection but often at the expense of enduring attention. This course invites students to critically analyze media contents and engage thought-provoking articles, initiating a meaningful dialogue with authors and peers. Through discussions, students will not only refine their analytical skills but also rethink the role of the media in today’s society.
N.B. Please note that while the course primarily centers around British and American media culture, students are encouraged to include local examples and incorporate interdisciplinary perspectives into the in-class conversation.
