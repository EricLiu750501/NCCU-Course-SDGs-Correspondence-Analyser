##  課程簡介Course Description
Compared to their developing counterparts, most advanced industrial countries have provided more complete welfare provision for the child and adolescent population. Also, child policy implementation in these nations has often provided important lessons for welfare latecomers for policy-making. Acknowledging this, in addition to Taiwanese child policy practices, this course will incorporate child welfare provision in advanced industrial countries into the discussion. 
Regarding the course structure, the conception of childhood will first be considered in the context of Western history, because its conceptual change triggered the birth of modern child welfare provision in the 20 th century. Also, Hardiker’s model will be introduced so as to analyze better multifaceted child welfare systems around the world. After that, we move on to study some important issues highly debated in international child policy scholarship. In this regard, both American and European country cases will be chosen for investigation in that their policy developments often have significantly impacted Taiwan’s policy-making. When turning to the research of specific child welfare policies, we will examine three core policy areas, including child protection, foster care and child poverty alleviation. Based on the Western policy lessons, the aim will be to figure out what solutions could help improve Taiwan’s service delivery. Finally, the last section will focus on recent reforms in international child welfare systems. These include integrated children's centres, the media's impact on children and service delivery under the principle of the child's best interests. Based on all the above accumulation of interchange between Western and Eastern policy knowledge, the course is aimed at determining how pro-child actors could be empowered to facilitate effective policy change.
