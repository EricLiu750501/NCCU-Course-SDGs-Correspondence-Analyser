##  課程簡介Course Description
3D modeling plays a crucial role in communication and prototyping, allowing designers, engineers, and creators to visualize and refine ideas before production. It helps convey complex concepts clearly, making it an essential tool in industries like product design, architecture, and engineering. With the rise of affordable software and 3D printing technology, these tools are now more accessible than ever. Free and open-source programs like Blender and low-cost CAD software enable anyone to create detailed models, while desktop 3D printers allow rapid prototyping at minimal cost. This accessibility empowers individuals and small teams to innovate, test ideas quickly, and bring functional designs to life.
This course introduces students to 3D modeling using both CAD software for technical applications and Blender for creative design. Students will learn the complete workflow of 3D modeling, including conceptualization, modeling, texturing, lighting, and rendering. The course emphasizes problem-solving through design, where students create functional objects that address specific needs.
In the first part of the course, students will focus on simple, real-world problems found at home. They will design and model objects that improve daily tasks or solve minor inconveniences. Selected models will be 3D printed to test their functionality. This hands-on approach helps students understand design constraints and material properties.
As the course progresses, students will work on more complex projects related to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They will identify challenges and design facilities, instruments, or workflows that provide solutions. The rendered 3D models will serve as visual communication tools to demonstrate functionality and feasibility.
By the end of the course, students will be able to create detailed 3D models, apply textures and lighting for realistic rendering, and present their designs effectively. They will also gain experience in translating digital models into physical objects through 3D printing. The course combines technical precision with creative exploration, preparing students to use 3D modeling for engineering, product design, and visual storytelling.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course aims to develop the ability to design, model, and visualize 3D objects for practical and conceptual purposes. By integrating CAD for technical precision and Blender for creative flexibility, students will gain a broader skill set applicable to engineering, product design, and visual communication. 
A key goal is to enhance problem-solving abilities by using 3D modeling to address real-world challenges, from everyday household issues to global concerns linked to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Students will also learn to translate digital designs into physical prototypes through 3D printing, reinforcing their understanding of material properties and functional design.
By the end of the course, students will be able to (1) conceptualize and develop 3D models for both technical and creative applications, (2) apply modeling, texturing, lighting, and rendering techniques to create realistic visualizations, (3) use 3D modeling as a problem-solving tool to design practical solutions, (4) communicate ideas effectively through rendered images and potentially also animated presentations, and (5) prepare models for 3D printing and evaluate their functionality.
Through hands-on projects and iterative design, students will build confidence in using 3D tools for prototyping and communication, preparing them for fields where digital modeling and communication are essential.
