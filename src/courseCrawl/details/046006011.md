##  課程簡介Course Description
This course aims to introduce fundamental concepts, principles, and applications of computational thinking and artificial intelligence, establishing a foundation for subsequent information technology-related coursework. In the 21st century digital era, developing computational thinking capabilities represents the essential first step toward effectively applying artificial intelligence technologies. Computational thinking encompasses the analytical processes for problem identification and solution formulation, wherein problem-solving procedures must adhere to computer operational logic. After developing abstract thinking skills, we will explore concrete computer operational architectures in more detail. The integration of these elements will be practiced through artificial intelligence programming applications. Additionally, we will investigate the developmental trajectory and future trends of artificial intelligence, and evaluate its impact on society, the economy, and culture.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
The course begins with an introduction to computational thinking, integrated with digital computer architecture fundamentals, to develop a comprehensive understanding of how computational thinking operates within computer systems. This foundational knowledge is subsequently extended into the artificial intelligence domain, where students will explore the fundamental principles of machine learning mechanisms. Through hands-on programming implementation, students will acquire preliminary competencies in designing intelligent systems relevant to their respective professional disciplines. Furthermore, the course will critically analyze the sociocultural impacts of artificial intelligence and examine associated ethical considerations.
