In recent years, Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important tool for solving social problems. However, due to its ongoing development, many gaps still need to be filled to meet the professional requirements of various industries. This course aims to train students to utilize the latest technologies in Generative AI and data science to develop projects that can address real-world challenges. The technology covered includes, but is not limited to, diverse content (such as text, audio, and video) connections, fine-tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
This course is offered in collaboration with AMD and the Taiwan AI Academy, which provide access to the latest AI computing equipment and real-world AI projects. Students who wish to enroll should have completed programming courses or be able to demonstrate basic proficiency in Python to meet the course’s skill requirements.
