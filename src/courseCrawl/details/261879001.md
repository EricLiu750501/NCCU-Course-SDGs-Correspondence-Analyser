##  課程簡介Course Description
The rapid development of artificial intelligence has created ethical debates about whether a robot, if one day it has self-consciousness, should be treated like a human being. Likewise, a growing demand for psychological therapies has resulted in/from the quest for meanings and purposes of being alive. Underlying these contemplations is a fundamental question: What makes a human a human? This course aims to facilitate discussions and provide potential answers from academic literature. 
Based on anthropological theory, ethnography, and cross-cultural comparison, this course introduces the formation of human society, life stages, and the phenomenology of ‘being human’. In the past ten years, there has been a trend of thought in the humanities and social sciences, debating the social and personal aspects of the positive sides of social life, such as expectations, dignity, values, ethics, empathy, care, freedom, and hope. This course will examine the subjective and objective conditions of well-being, reflecting on how well-being is perceived, defined, and created. Through lectures, class discussions, student presentations on the required readings, and field trips/documentaries/guest speeches, this course attempts to cultivate students’ ability to care for society and themselves.
This course begins with introducing basic concepts and epistemology of anthropological theory and ethnography. We will unpack what anthropologists have called ‘culture’ and ‘society’ and consider how themes of this kind lead to a reconsideration of how anthropological theory and ethnographies might be useful for comprehending the development of humanity. After providing an overview, each week’s topic will focus on key issues discussed in the sub-fields of Cognitive and Psychological Anthropology, Medical Anthropology, Religious Anthropology, Environmental Anthropology, and Positive Anthropology. Throughout, this course will focus on the relationship between self and society and that between mind, body, and the more intangible aspects such as emotion and spirit. We will look at how universal human capabilities develop and are used during different stages of life to create unique cultural understandings and practices.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course contains lectures, student presentations and in-class discussions. These activities are based on reading materials and the instructor's lecture slides. Apart from lectures, students are expected to summarise reading materials on the topic(s) they sign-up for at the beginning of the term and present their thoughts in the class (at least 1 presentation, depending on the class size). This course will emphasise analytical perspectives and critical thinking. Students are required to read before classes and bring their reflections and questions to in-class discussions. In addition to presentations, students are expected to write reading notes. Finally, this course encourages students to apply their knowledge to the real world by analysing a case related to the topics mentioned in this course. Students are expected to demonstrate their findings both in presentations and written works.
