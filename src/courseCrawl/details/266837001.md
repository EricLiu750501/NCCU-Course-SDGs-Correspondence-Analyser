##  課程簡介Course Description
This course familiarizes students with several flagship large‑scale international survey data, including the World Values Survey (WVS), East Asian Social Survey (EASS), International Social Survey Programme (ISSP), Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), and the WHO Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE). Through a combination of lectures, hands‑on exercises, a research proposal, and a final empirical project, students will master cross‑national survey design, data cleaning and documentation, weighting, measurement validity checks, cross‑country dataset integration, data analysis and hypothesis testing, and concise written and oral reporting. Demonstrations in class will use R. However, students may complete assignments with any statistical software (e.g., Python, Stata, SAS, SPSS, etc.). There are no formal prerequisites for this course. However, prior completion of (or concurrent enrolment in) an introductory statistics or quantitative research‐methods course is strongly recommended.
