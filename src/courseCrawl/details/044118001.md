What does it mean to resist existing structures of oppression? What strategies and tactics are possible? What forms of solidarity emerge through moments of resistance? This course explores resistance primarily through literature, social theory, and law. This course seeks to understand resistance through global history and law, with a broad range in both chronology and geography. It defines resistance in the broadest sense of the term, examining activists, artists, lawyers, and protesters who have employed cultural, political, social, and economic strategies to challenge existing legal structures。
