##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
本課程教學目標為提升中高級華語之深度與廣度，協助學生從句子發展成段落的能力。除了教授語言本體的知識，也關注更寬廣的領域，例如台灣的社會、文化、歷史等知識，並透過實際生活的應用，如校外教學等活動，讓學生能將課堂上之所學實踐於生活中，使其在目標語環境中與他人溝通時，在聽說讀寫方面均能更擴展其所欲表達的思想與意見。
The instructional objective of this course is to enhance the depth and breadth of intermediate high Chinese language proficiency, facilitating students' ability to develop sentences into cohesive paragraphs. In addition to imparting knowledge of the language itself, the course also addresses a broader range of topics, such as Taiwanese society, culture, and history. Through practical application in real-life contexts, such as field trips, students are encouraged to implement their classroom learning into their daily lives. This approach aims to expand their ability to express thoughts and opinions in listening, speaking, reading, and writing within the target language environment, thus improving their communication with others.

##  評量工具與策略、評分標準成效Evaluation Criteria
**Grading and Requirements:**
  * **Homework and Assignments (****20****%****)**  
  
Homework will be assigned throughout the semester and will be based on the materials covered in class. All homework should be handed in **on time at the beginning of class**. Each assignment will be graded on a 100-point basis. **No late homework will be accepted! Any incomplete assignment will be checked but will receive no credits.**


  * **Quizzes (20%)**  
  
There will be **in-class quizzes** , mainly based on new vocabulary(dictation) and grammatical points. It is students’ responsibility to keep track of the quizzes as listed in the course schedule. No make-up quizzes will be given unless students have a **documented** **excuse** (e.g., a medical excuse) **and** follow the policy for make-up quizzes and tests.  



  * **Midterm and Final Exams (40%)**  
  
There will be **two major exams**. They are comprehensive tests that will cover all the materials learned up to that point. **Absolutely no make-up tests will be given unless students have a documented excuse** (e.g., a medical excuse) **and** follow the policy for make-up quizzes and tests.


  * **Class Participation (****10****%)**  
  
The instructor expects **active participation** from students in class and encourages them to ask questions and share outside knowledge at all times during class. 


  * **Attendance****(10%)**  
  
For each 1-hour unexcused absence, **1 point** will be deducted from this portion of the grade. Any official documentation for absences needs to be submitted to the instructor within **3 days** after the student returns to class or else the student’s absence will be counted as an **unexcused absence** and the student may incur the **1-point penalty**. 


The class sign-in sheet is only available for the **first 10 minutes** of class, so if students do not arrive by then, it will be counted as absent. **Leaving class early is not allowed** unless there is an emergency. In **rare** situations when students have to leave the class early, they need to obtain the instructor’s permission **before** class begins. Otherwise, leaving early will count as an unexcused absence. 
**Any student is allowed 15 unexcused absences (15 hours) during the term.**
Students who miss 16-24 hours of the course will be awarded 9 course credits instead of the full 12, resulting in a loss of 3 credits.  
Students who miss 25-33 hours of the course will be awarded 6 course credits instead of the full 12, resulting in a loss of 6 credits.   
Students who miss 34-42 hours of the course will be awarded 3 course credits instead of the full 12, resulting in a loss of 9 credits.  
Students who miss more than 42 hours of the course will be awarded 0 course credit instead of the full 12, resulting in a loss of 12 credits.
