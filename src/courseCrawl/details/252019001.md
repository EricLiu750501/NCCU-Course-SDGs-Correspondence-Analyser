##  課程簡介Course Description
This course consists of three major themes: probability theory, hypothesis testing, and experiments. These themes serve as the foundation for students to pursue further studies in advanced statistical analysis and methods such as models with fixed and random effects, time series data, and Bayesian modeling. The order of the themes is arranged in a way to ensure that students understand the fundamentals (probability, descriptive statistics, probability distribution, and sampling distribution) before knowing how to make statistical inferences (hypothesis tests, experiments, and regression analysis). In addition to the lectures, we have labs in which the students will learn how to use R codes to carry out analytical tasks related to the topics we have covered in class.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course aims to equip students with the necessary statistical tools and concepts to analyze and interpret data within the context of social science research. The primary learning goals include (1) learning to summarize and describe the essential features of a dataset; (2) understanding the principles of drawing conclusions about populations based on sample data; (3) gaining an understanding of probability and probability/sampling distributions and their application in social science research.; (4) understanding various statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests, etc.) and when to use them, and (5) digging in how to design, conduct, analyze, and interpret experimental research within the context of social science. By achieving these learning goals, students should be well-equipped to conduct rigorous and valid statistical analyses in their social science research, contributing to the advancement of knowledge in social sciences.
