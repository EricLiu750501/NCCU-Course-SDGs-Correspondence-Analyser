Mainstream journals dedicated digital games including Media Psychology, Journal of Computer Mediated Communication, New Media and Society, Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, and Computers in Human Behavior. Second, be able to critically analyze and interpret how scholars in these fields frame research issues and investigate the effects of these two media on human being. Third, be able to build logical and precise argument to contribute to advance the knowledge of these two fields, theoretically and empirically. All students should be able to propose a clear-designed, well-argued research proposal at the end of the semester.
