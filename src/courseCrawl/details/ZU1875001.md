##  課程簡介Course Description
The notion of Gaia-politics challenges traditional approaches to sovereignty by taking more seriously the _geo_ of geopolitics, that is to say its environmental dimension. War ecology is another concept that aims to address the concomitance of the climate emergency with more traditional threats on national security including military and civilian defense. Through guess lectures, off campus visits and negotiation theaters, the class focuses on the case of Taiwan in comparison with other countries. 
In 2023, this course focused on conflicts between humans and non-humans. In 2024, we paid more attention to the role of social movements (such as environmental protection and antinuclear mobilization), and how they connect with national politics, in particular state agencies and the parliament. In 2025, while keeping focused on interspecies justice, social movements and national politics, we will further explore with a critical eye the catchwords of ‘social resilience’, ‘technological innovation’ and ‘energy transition’, and how these effectively influence collective preparation to climate change and war scenarios.
「蓋婭政治」(Gaia-politics)的概念挑戰了「主權」 概念的傳統取徑，因為蓋婭政治更認真看待「地緣 政治」中的「地緣」，也就是其環境面向。「戰爭生態學」(war ecology)則是另一個概念，旨在面對氣 候緊急狀態與傳統國安威脅(包括軍事與民間防 衛)共存的局勢。
透過客座課程、校外參訪與協商劇場的形式，本課 程將聚焦於台灣相較於其他國家的情勢。2023年， 本課程聚焦於人類與非人類之間的衝突。2024年， 我們更注重社會運動(如環保與反核運動)的角 色，以及它們如何與國內政治——特別是政府機構與國會——產生連結。
2025年，我們將在延續對跨物種正義、社會運動與 國家政治的關注之餘，進一步批判性地探討「社會 韌性」、「科技創新」與「能源轉型」這些關鍵詞，並 檢視它們如何實質地影響集體面對氣候變遷與戰爭 情境的準備與應對能力。

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Through a series of lectures and group discussions, this class aims to challenge classical views on the environment from the viewpoint of national defense.
We therefore look at problems such as how climate change affects the water cycle, the life cycle of plants and animals, corals, their importance for national security in terms of food and energy security, their meaning for national sovereignty. For instance, given the high risk of earthquakes, nuclear plants are particularly dangerous in Taiwan, but they could be helpful in case of a maritime blockade.
This class will help you identifying your own priorities between conflicting values and policies and what alliances you need to get these goals achieved. In other words, how do you mobilize with who to defend what you care for the most? For instance, to take some caricatural examples, will you focus on preventing a nuclear disaster or preventing an electricity black out? The semiconductor industry is both a defense asset (the ‘silicon shield’) and a big consumer of water and electricity : will you choose to further develop it or focus on protecting water resources because no one can survive without water?
I therefore expect you to engage actively in class discussion, including our guests and yourselves. The latter is even more important because university is one of the best place and time in your life to make friends and develop bonds that will influence your whole professional career.
The first weeks—until mid-term presentations—will be devoted to provide you key concepts through lectures and visits off-campus (to the Legislative Yuan), and initiate you to _negotiation theaters_ , a training method to develop political and diplomatic skills, the practice of which will make the core of the second term.
Typically, during the first term, after a lecture by me or the guest lecturer, I will briefly present the question to be debated and to be voted, as if we were in a parliament. Then the class will be divided into small groups with a specific profile (e.g., government, business, NGO, lawmaker, etc.) to find a strategy that will convince other stakeholders. The final stage looks like the general assembly of the parliament: each group has to present its policy proposal. I will identify conflicting interests and eventually push you to make compromises so that we can finally decide a policy and vote the budget.
Last year, this class format proved to be both rich in content and inclusive for everyone. It was also instrumental to break the language barriers such as between English and Chinese. And we had a lot of fun! 
透過一系列的課程講授與小組討論，本課程旨在從國防的觀點來挑戰傳統上對環境的看法。因此，我們將探討氣候變遷如何影響水循環、動植物和珊瑚礁的生命週期，以及這些議題在糧食與能源安全上的國安意涵，進一步思考它們與國家主權的關係。舉例來說，因台灣地震風險極高，核電廠因此特別危險；但在遭受海上封鎖的情況下，核電可能又具有戰略價值。
本課程將幫助你在相衝突的價值與政策之間，只認出自己的優先順序，並思考你需要與哪些人結盟、動員哪些力量，來達成目標。換句話說，你要如何動員、與誰合作、為了捍衛什麼？比如，舉一些誇張的例子，你會選擇致力防止核能災難，還是防止大規模停電？半導體產業算是台灣國防的重要因素（所謂的「矽盾」），但它也大量耗水耗電：你會選擇優先保護水資源，因為沒有水就會活下去？
因此，我期待你們積極參與課堂討論，無論是與客座講者還是你們彼此之間的互動。甚至可以說後者更為重要，因為大學是你人生中結交友誼、建立人脈的最佳時機，這些關係將可能深遠地影響你的職業生涯。
到期中報告之前的數週，本課程將以講授與校外參訪（如立法院等）來給同學們掌握關鍵概念，並接觸所謂的「協商劇場」（negotiation theater）這一訓練方法。這是一種培養政治與外交技巧的實務演練，並將成為學期後半段課程的核心內容。
通常在課程的第一部分，在我或客座講師講課後，我會簡要說明當日要辯論與表決的問題，猶如我們身處國會之中。然後，全班會被分成以特定立場代表的小組（例如政府部門、企業、非政府組織、立法委員等），每組須提出能說服其他利害關係人的策略。課程的最終階段就像一場立法院內的大會：每組都要提出自己的政策提案。我會指出各方的利益衝突，並引導你們進行協商，最終形成一項政策並進行預算表決。
去年，這樣的課程設計在內容上十分充實，並能融合各種背景的學生參與。我們也成功克服了語言障礙，例如中英文之間的隔閡。整體來說大家學得多，也玩得非常開心！

##  評量工具與策略、評分標準成效Evaluation Criteria
**Participation** (oral intervention and/or written notes): 70% (absence without prior approval will affect your grade)
**Abstract and Final Essay** : 30%
Regarding class participation, the first requirement is to attend the class on time, be attentive and responsive. In other words, the quality of your presence will be the most important criteria for evaluation.
To appreciate your contribution, you will have to perform an oral brief of your assigned role in the small group (during the first half of the semester) and the political party you will be part of (during the second half). The preparation of that individual performance will therefore be collective; you won’t be alone and group dynamic will boost your morale. You are also welcome to send me your written notes by emails after the class.
During the lectures (which are short, around 30 minutes), you will refrain from watching your electronic device. During small group discussion, you can search the web for information, check sources and use AI to improve the preparation of your oral brief, but you will refrain from using your electronic device for unrelated purpose such as online chatting. Actually, you won’t have much time for that.
I understand that discussion in English is more demanding if it is not your mother tongue, but don’t worry, it’s not mine either, so I will do my best to make the class inclusive for everyone and compatible with a diversity of languages; at least it will be Chinese-compatible.
The final essay (around 1000 words) will be a reflection on your own participation in this class, with a focus on the performance of your political party. What ideas did you and your party develop? Which ones do you value the most and you would like to continue to promote in the future? What where you and your party particularly good at? Where did you and your party fail? How would you do better next time? How about other parties? What was sincere? What was fake or to cynical? What did you like? What did you dislike? Etc. You can critically use AI to improve the language of your essay but the idea is to deliver a self-reflection on your own experience and your own feelings. Because your emotions matter for what you think and want to be.
關於課堂參與，第一個要求是準時出席課程，並在課堂上保持專注和積極互動。換句話說，同學在場表現將會是評量最重要的標準。
為了確認你的貢獻，你會需要以自己在小組中分派到的角色（學期上半段）以及你所屬的政黨（學期下半段）來進行口頭簡報。這些個人發表的準備都會是集體作業，所以你不會是孤軍奮戰，有小組的動力也會增強信心。在課後，你也可以將你的書面筆記透過電子郵件寄給我。
在講授課程期間（通常很短，大約30分鐘），你會需要避免查看電子設備。而在小組討論階段，你可以上網查閱資訊、核對來源，也能善用AI來提升口頭簡報的準備工作；但是，須避免將電子裝置用於不相干的用途，例如線上聊天。事實上，你應該也沒什麼時間做那些事。
我明白若英語不是你的母語，要進行討論會比較有挑戰；但請不用擔心，英語也不是我的母語，所以我會盡力讓這門課能包容所有人，並能適應多元語言；至少，這堂課可以兼容中文。
期末報告（約一千英文字或兩千中文字）將會是你自己對在這門課參與經驗的反思，重點會放在你所屬政黨的表現上。你和你的政黨提出了哪些主張？哪些主張最能體現你的價值觀、值得延續？你和你的政黨在哪些部分表現突出？在哪些地方遇到失敗？下次會怎麼改進？其他政黨如何？哪些想法是真誠的、哪些又太虛假或憤世嫉俗？你喜歡什麼、不喜歡什麼？諸如此類。你可以批判性地利用AI來優化你的文章語言，但這份作業的重心是對自己經驗與感受的自我反思，因為你的情緒，會影響你如何思考，以及未來想成為什麼樣的人。
