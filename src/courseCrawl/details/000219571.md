##  課程簡介Course Description
This is the first part of a one-year introductory course to economics. This semester we will focus on microeconomics. Microeconomics, according to Professor Mankiw, is the study of how households and firms make decisions and how they interact in specific markets. This course will present basic analytical tools and apply them to the traditional applied fields of microeconomics such as public finance, international trade, industrial organization and labor economics. Recent theoretical development such as game theory will also be introduced.
