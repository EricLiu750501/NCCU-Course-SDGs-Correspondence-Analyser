##  課程簡介Course Description
_Reading and Oral Training_ is a one-semester course for high-intermediate to advanced learners of English. The course, which is conducted in English, is designed to acclimate students to using English as a tool for advanced communication. During the course, students will enhance their reading and speaking skills through lectures, pair/group discussions, oral presentations, role-play, writing assignments, watching films, and other in-class activities. Students will become familiar with different communication styles and methods of organization for handling discussion and presentation of contemporary issues through a combination of reading materials and speaking exercises on various subjects from different sources, such as novels, news media, blog posts, and academic articles. Students will also learn to summarize texts, analyze structure (through outlining), compare and contrast, and give opinions, which can be extended to more advanced reading skills, e.g. identifying facts and opinions, and making inferences in class.

Class time will be devoted to activities that allow you to practice and interact in English. To successfully complete the course, you must prepare the assigned homework prior to class and actively participate in class discussions, online discussions, and pair/group work. Your final grades are determined by the following course components:

**ASSIGNMENTS AND****REQUIREMENTS** **Attendance & participation** Your attendance mark is based on the average minutes you are present in class, and the mark will be calculated with 100-point scale , whereas participation grade will be based on homework preparation, and the contribution you make to the learning experience of others. Contribution includes your in-class questions to the instructor, insights and comments regarding class content, answers to the instructor's questions, and reactions to other students' contributions. You will need to submit proper document in order for the instructor to mark your absence as an excused leave. If the final mark for the attendance is **lower than 80, this attendance mark will be zero**. **Humans in Our Life: Writing** You will **interview someone you do not know**. Think of the questions you might be asking before you choose your interviewee. Write up the person's story in writing. You also have to **gain this person's consent to take photos of him/her**. It is suggested that his/her story is worth reading and the readers can learn something. **You will also have to add your own self-reflection on the story**. **Oral presentations** You will give three types of oral presentations during the semester: 2 group presentation, individual speech (Daily Dedication), and poster session (short story).
  1.     1. **Group Presentation 1 (20%)** : Each group will take up one chapter of the book and use 25-30 minutes to lead the discussion regarding the chapter of your choice.
    2. **Group Presentation 2 (15%)** : Each group will try to think of a feasible business they are going to establish. The presentation should be 15-20 minutes.
    3. **Individual Speech (10%)** : Each person will choose their own topic to introduce to the audience. Everyone will present their own presentation on the same day as its our class's TEDx Talk. It should be 3-4 minutes long.
    4. **Book summary video (15%)** : In a group of three or four, choose a book, and make a video to describe what the book is about. The video should be 10-12 minutes long, and everyone should take a speaking role. Example: https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=306783181072838

See the attachment for **the grading rubric** **Mid-term exam: 15%** The exam is based on an assigned reading that will be distributed a week earlier or two. Class discussion will be given a week ahead for you all to brainstorm what you can connect to. The exam is mainly on testing your critical thinking skills; therefore, as long as your ideas are conveyed successfully, grammar and sentence structures do not matter much.
