##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
The course requires the students to develop a working system for a real-life application on PC and mobile APP. The project lasts for three semesters. During the project course, the students are required to present their progress periodically. At the end of the third semester, each team is required to demonstrate their projects in a competition event.
The student will exercise their knowledge of:
  * Planning the development of an application system.
  * The system's life cycle and development methodologies.
  * Tools for systems analysis and design.
  * Determination of information requirements.
  * Developing design alternatives.
  * Input/output designs.
  * Analysis and design of logical databases.
  * The use of a development environment (Eclipse, Dreamweaver, etc.) to construct an application system.
  * The role of systems design and implementation patterns in a business organization.
  * Implementing an application system with a team of project members.
  * Applying the system components to the construction of an integrated application system.
  * Applying structured design techniques to the construction of an integrated application system.
  * Applying structured testing techniques to the verification of an integrated application system.

##  評量工具與策略、評分標準成效Evaluation Criteria
1. GRADE DISTRIBUTION:
Weekly meeting attendance (1% x 18) 18%
Meeting participation 36%
Group peer evaluation form 6%
Term project deliverable 40%
Total 100%
2. CONTRIBUTION EVALUATION:
You are expected to attend each meeting on time with the assigned readings prepared in advance and to contribute to the meeting discussion either by starting the discussion or building on the contribution of others to move the discussion forward. The sharing of your experience and insights is a key part of the leaning process. To build on the contribution of others requires you to listen and to consider the timing of your participation.
Meaningful meeting participants will be a factor in the determination of your grade. As in all meetings the more you put into a meeting the more you get out of it. We encourage the sharing of ideas with the meeting during meeting discussions. You are of course responsible for all material discussed in meeting even if you are absent. If you miss a meeting you must get notes from someone else in the meeting and you should designate someone to pick up any handouts for you. When you attend a meeting you must be on time and remain for the entire meeting.
The quality and frequency of your contribution will be taken into account in the grading scheme and will include the quality of your responses when cold-called. You will be evaluated after every meeting session using the following criteria. Please note that contributions are NOT equivalent to only attending the meeting or talking in a meeting. The quality of what is said and of one's listening and responding to others are important components of my evaluation.
Excellent Participation (A): (1) regularly initiates meeting discussions; (2) contributes consistently to meeting discussions; (3) regularly gives indication of substantial knowledge and insights; (4) frequently facilitates others in clarifying and developing their own viewpoints; (5) regularly builds on the thinking of others and integrates that thinking into own contributions to produce a larger synergistic understanding of the issues being discussed.
Good Participation (B): (1) frequently initiates meeting discussions; (2) contributes consistently to meeting discussions; (3) regularly indicates substantial knowledge and insights; (4) occasionally facilitates others in clarifying and developing their viewpoints.
Fair Participation (C): (1) occasionally initiates meeting discussions; (2) contributes occasionally to meeting discussions; (3) gives an indication of some knowledge and insights; (4) almost never responds constructively to the contribution of others.
Poor Participation (D): (1) never or almost never initiates meeting discussions; (2) never or almost never contributes to meeting discussions; (3) is late for, does not attend, or is not prepared for 3 or more meetings; (4) actively inhibits or impedes the course of discussion; (5) exhibits defensive behavior such as aggression or withdrawal rather than being thoughtful and considerate of others' ideas.
Failing Participation (F): (1) never or almost never initiates meeting discussions; (2) never or almost never contributes to meeting discussions; (3) is late for, does not attend, or is not prepared for 6 or more meetings; (4) actively inhibits or impedes the course of discussion; (5) exhibits defensive behavior such as aggression or withdrawal rather than being thoughtful and considerate of others' ideas.
