##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Activities in class cover a broad spectrum. Emphasis is placed on class participation. Considerable time is spent on data analysis, discussing several examples. A small number of lectures cover specific statistical topics. Some time is spent discussing report writing, oral communication, consulting session management, and consulting philosophy. Some use is made of videotapes. In conjunction with major data analyses, clients come to class for questioning. There are occasional guest lectures on diverse topics. The latter part of the semester is devoted to the discussion of student consulting projects.
##  每周課程進度與作業要求 Course Schedule & Requirements
The class materials are divided into three parts: Problem Definition, Data Analysis, and Communication. There are 6~7 regular-based homework assignments, one mid-term project, and one final project. 
1. Class Introduction (Week 1) 
2. Problem Definition (Weeks 2~4, Assignment 1) 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Weeks 5~7, Assignment 2&3) 
4. Mid-term Project (Week 8)
5. Confirmatory Data Analysis (Weeks 9~11, Assignment 4)
6. Research Methods and Report Writing (Weeks 12~13, Assignment 5)
7. Ethics and Presentation Skills (Weeks 14~15, Assignment 6) 
8. Applications (Weeks 16)
9. Final Report (Week 17) 
There is a mid-term data analysis problem for which written reports are required, with the client comes in to be interviewed in class and each student finishing his/her individual report. A final (major) project consists of an actual consulting experience for each student with a required oral presentation and written report. In addition, there are a number of short written reports and in-class discussion assignments on a variety of topics. There include brief write-ups on more “minor” data analyses. There are some assigned readings as well as videotape viewing. The majority of the work load occurs in the first 2/3 of the course.

All other assignments together are 35% and participations (e.g., in-class discussions) in the class count 10%. Improvement over the semester is viewed favorably in grading.
