##  課程簡介Course Description
In this course, we will focus on reading comprehension and the _process_ of writing at the university level: brainstorming new ideas, organizing those ideas, conducting research, using quotations and citations, writing drafts and revising, and peer reviewing. We will develop these skills by preparing to write two different, but interrelated forms of academic essay. We will continue to work on our sentence structure and paragraph development and proceed to the challenge of larger structures of composition: 1) Argument and 2) Research essays being the two primary categories this term. The goals of the course include strengthening your critical thinking and reading skills, your ability to analyze and synthesize information, and your skills at researching, organizing, and presenting written text.In this course, we will focus on reading comprehension and the _process_ of writing at the university level: brainstorming new ideas, organizing those ideas, conducting research, using quotations and citations, writing drafts and revising, and peer reviewing.
