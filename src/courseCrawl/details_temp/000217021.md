##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Through this course, the attempt is made to build in students basic analytical skills that, jointly with skills learned from macroeconomics, will enable them to understand and cope with real-world economic issues. As such, students are encouraged to apply theory to practice and also to reason on the basis of sound Economics theories. Students will organize small groups to read and report, as a team, academic journal papers which demonstrate how microeconomic theories and analytical frameworks are applied to real-world issues.
In addition to the knowledge of Microeconomics theories, the participants will gain experience in doing academic literature reviews and writing-up that summarizes key points and insights of the reviewed academic literature.
In the Fall semester, we will focus on the concepts of optimization and consumer theory from Microeconomics perspectives, while production and cost theories will be introduced in the Spring semester.
_A. Lectures:_
Fall semester:
Part 0: Introduction to Microeconomics: covering Ch. 1.
Part I: Utility-Maximizing Choice: Consumers, workers, and savers theories: covering Chapters 2 to 10.
Spring semester:

Part III: Competitive Markets and the “invisible hand”, covering Ch. 14-16.
Part IV: Distortions of the “invisible hand” in Competitive Markets, covering Ch. 18-21.
Part V: Distortions of the “invisible hand” from strategic Decisions, covering Ch. 23-25.
_B. Group projects:_
Journal papers on consumer-related topics (Fall semester); producer and factor market-related topics (Spring semester).
##  每周課程進度與作業要求 Course Schedule & Requirements
Averagely, one chapter will take one week’s lecture time, although some chapters may take more or less time than average. As the university policy requires, students will need to spend at the minimum three hours per week on top of the lecture of the week. I suggest the students of this course study the main textbook before the weekly lecture so as to get better comprehension of the lecture and also more involved participation in the class discussion on the applications and analyses of the theories introduced. Oral presentations of the small groups are scheduled in the later part of the semester, and written reports should be submitted by the last week of the semester.
Part A. Weekly lectures:
To be announced in the first class and fixed in the fifth class.
Part B. Group projects:
Students are asked to organize small groups (size to be decided in the first class meeting) to read and report, as a team, academic journal papers or books which demonstrate how microeconomic theories and analytical framework, as introduced in the course, are applied in real-world issues.
Students need to find their partners for the group project and make a preliminary presentation on the project topic, and outline by the designated dates. Groups have to set their work schedule and management plan for the project. Formal presentations of the group projects consist of two parts: oral and written. Oral presentations shall be given after the final exam of this course, and written reports are due the last week of the semester.
