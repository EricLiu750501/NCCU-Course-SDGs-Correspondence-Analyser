You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This is a required course for graduate students in the Department of Management Information Systems. Building on your undergraduate foundation in management science—including mathematical programming, simulation, and forecasting—we now shift the focus toward decision-making under uncertainty. Students will explore decision models where parameters and outcomes are uncertain. We will deepen our discussion of discrete and continuous probability distributions, which are critical tools for evaluating decisions in stochastic environments. A central theme of the course is the use of stochastic simulation modeling to analyze and solve a variety of business decision problems. We will cover advanced topics such as stochastic dependencies and numerical optimization algorithms. The course will conclude with applications to inventory control models, with a focus on both manufacturing systems and service supply chain management.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
The primary goal of this course is to sharpen students’ quantitative reasoning skills, particularly in situations where decision outcomes are uncertain or random. By the end of the course, students are expected to develop a solid understanding of applied probability modeling and Monte Carlo simulation. The focus is on empowering students to confidently apply these techniques to real-world decision-making under uncertainty.
Probabilistic computation will be at the heart of this course. Python will be the primary programming language. The best way to master the material is through hands-on practice—writing and testing your own code will be essential for effective learning. While the use of large language models (LLMs) as programming aids is encouraged, it is crucial that you truly understand the logic and methods behind the code you produce. The ultimate goal is not just to get results, but to deeply grasp the reasoning that drives them.
