##  課程簡介Course Description
_Course Description_
_Ethnography is at the foundation of all theoretical developments in the discipline of anthropology. As such, it is a powerful tool through which to understand contemporary historical issues and developments. Ethnographic theory is intertwined with the method of participant observation, which illuminates historical processes and theoretical concepts through deep descriptions of lived experiences. In this class we will review the development of key epistemological frameworks to understand ethnography as a particular way of knowing about the world. Ethnography is also a way of being in the world. Reflexive and aware, the ethnographer engages with lived experiences to document what people say about what they do, what they actually do, and the political, economic, and environmental outcomes of particular sets of actions. Through this interaction of ways of knowing and ways of being, the practice of ethnography offers insights into the human condition and human systems from multiple subject positions—those of the theorist or historian, those of studied community, and those of the ethnographer. In this course we will learn about the various theories of ethnography from a historical perspective, but we will do this with a critical eye with the objective of transforming rather than reproducing current knowledge. By the end of the course, students will have a solid grasp on the ways that theories, methods, and reflection combine through ethnographic writing toward critical analytical insights. Ethnography teaches us about ourselves and others, providing important knowledge about the development and transformations of cultures._
“ _In times of change learners inherit the earth; while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists_.” Eric Hoffer

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Learning Outcomes:
Students will have a strong grasp of the intellectual and political history of ethnographic investigations, as well as an understanding of the foundational and current theories of ethnography. 
Critical analysis is key to this course and students will be able to apply it to all kinds of documents using the Elements of Critical Assessment and Analysis (ACE-A). 
_Three-credit course_
To achieve the three-credit course requirement, this course offers at least 54 hours of instruction.
We will meet physically in class for 3-hour sessions weekly (42 hours). Week 8 is a mid-term take-home exam. Week 16 is the final take-home exam. 
Office hour instruction is offered each week (3 hours/wk. adding 48 hours of additional instruction opportunities). 
_Weekly Summary_ :
Summary of each week’s reading, max 1000 words, due before the beginning of class. Learn to identify the author’s main argument and to situate the work in your own thinking. Practice and internalize the functions and philosophies of citations and cross referencing. 
_Exams:_
Exams are designed for learning, not testing. Take-home, open-book exams will consist of 4 short essay questions or a single literature review of course material 4-6000 words.
_Artificial Intelligence_
AI is a tool, like a calculator. Why, exactly it was so vigorously developed and deployed at this historical moment, especially considering its massive impact on water and energy use, is an important question to consider. If students wish to stop thinking in order to advance their careers there is little that the academic institution can do, except to inform you and set certain parameters. AI does not generate knowledge and makes strange mistakes. Its use for crafting papers or understanding assigned essays will be obvious in this class. Using it as a tool to improve the readability of your independently crafted article is acceptable, other uses are lazy and wasteful of common pool resources.
