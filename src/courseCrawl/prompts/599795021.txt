##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
In this class, learners will practice writing as a process of invention and revision that anyone can master with effort. Students will review basic paragraph structure and then learn about common rhetorical forms. They will practice several types of essays including narrative, comparison/contrast, cause-effect, and argument. Literacy skills are incorporated as learners search online sources, learn to cite them, and create a reference list. In sum, students will gain a foundational understanding of English composition and learn the writing process as they develop their own writing and revising toolkit. 
By the end of the semester, those who have satisfactorily completed the course requirementswill be able to identify a compelling topic, decide how to treat it in writing, and compose a strong and thoughtful essay to explore or argue it. Students will be familiar with elements of good academic compositions including organization, thesis statements, and clarity of ideas. Finally, students will learn the mechanics of academic writing such as document format, and citations and reference lists.
