##  課程簡介Course Description
Since at least the 1970s, parenting and parent-child interaction have emerged as prominent and evolving areas of study. Today, this discipline encompasses several core dimensions, including the cognition, emotion, and behavior involved in parent-child dynamics.
This course is structured as a “journal club” or “study group,” inviting students to critically examine cutting-edge research on parenting and parent–child relationships. We will closely explore various aspects of modern parent–child dynamics—including what parents think (parenting cognition), what they feel (parental emotion), how they interact with their children (parenting styles and practices across developmental stages), what they do in the digital media era, and how these dimensions collectively shape the parent–child relationship.
Students are expected not only to engage with scholarly articles but also to lead group presentations, participate actively in class discussions, and design and present an original research proposal related to parent-child relationships. Through these diverse learning activities, the course aims to strengthen students’ analytical and communication skills, which are essential for academic and professional development in developmental psychology and family studies.
