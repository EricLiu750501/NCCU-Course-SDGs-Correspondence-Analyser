##  課程簡介Course Description
This course introduces the foundational concepts and practical approaches in public policy analysis and advocacy. Public policy is any decisions and actions (or indecisions and inactions) of governments. Public policy analysis is a tool to inform policymakers’ decisions, and policy advocacy is the technique to engage with stakeholders and communicate with the public to pursue the policy change. This course will cover key stages in policy analysis and advocacy, such as problem identification, policy formulation, decision-making, advocacy, and adoption. Through case-based learning and theoretical grounding, students will explore how policy problems are defined, options developed and evaluated, and stakeholder interests negotiated. Students will complete a comprehensive policy analysis project and participate in a mock press conference, developing analytical, communication, and civic leadership skills.
