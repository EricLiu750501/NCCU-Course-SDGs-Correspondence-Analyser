You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
Looking at the global world, there are a lot of puzzling development and heartbreaking moments. The wars, the tariff chaos, the climate disasters, the generative AI boom. But fundamentally, it is about global governance, about the global environment we share together, and about how data and technology, especially generative AI, help shape the world. And all these are core elements consist of the basis of International College of Innovation (ICI). As the _opening_ course that welcomes you to ICI, this course aims to prepare you with the foundational knowledge and perspective that could guide your further learning in ICI. 
This course takes a global perspective to understand contemporary society — a "world society" beyond the boundary of national states. This means we move our focus beyond the boundary of Taiwan (or any other countries) to pay attention to issues happening in other countries and regions. Meanwhile, we will also move beyond the typical focus on the U.S. or western Europe to care more for other regions in the world. More importantly, we focus on interconnectedness across countries and between different societies. In specific, this course focuses on political-economic, ecological, and technological dimensions of globalization from a historical perspective. That also means I will need your help to bring your own experience from all over the world. 
To facilitate you to better understand the origins, mechanisms, and consequences of our increasingly interconnected world, this course will be divided into three parts:
  * The first part looks into the international order underpinning current global connections and _moves_ of humans and non-humans. 
  * The second part concerns the current status and the future of global environment.
  * The third part is about the role of science, technology and innovation (STI) for global development.
_Course Format_
  * Class Activity & Short Lecture:
My role will be a facilitator who supports your learning. In particular, this course is built on group discussion and collective learning. Most learning will be based on reading assigned materials, discussion, and class activities. I will supplement these activities with short lectures that help contextualize readings, articulate learning themes across weeks, and move the discussion forward.
  * A Student-centered Learning App roach:
I employ a _student-centered learning approach_ in this course rather than a traditional lecture format (i.e., you listen to lectures to learn knowledge). The methods of learning in this course, thus, involve two major aspects: 
  *     * Careful and critical reading of assigned materials. I will provide a _weekly study guide_ to help you think and read materials with _intention_.
    * Bring your memo and your reading questions to the classroom. Get involved in class activities, and learn from each other.
_Learning Activities_
  * Collective Annotation & Weekly Memo:
For most of the weeks, you will have assigned readings. I will provide guiding questions for each assigned reading to help you navigate and understand readings. You will need to make annotations on a shared PDF with your groupmates and write your own reading memo before every class. At the end of every class, you will also have the opportunity to expand your memo with what you learn during the class. 
  * Round-Table Project
Throughout the course, you will accomplish three group projects with your groupmates. These small group projects are designed to help you learn how to work with your fellow students and to learn from practicing. These Round-Table projects are also opportunities that we will collaborate together to create a bigger project and learn from each other. I will introduce the detailed arrangement of round-table project at the beginning of the semester and will have detailed guideline to help you _learn to work together_. 
  * “The World This Week” curation
To facilitate you to cultivate familiarity with issues across the globe and to stay connected with the global world, I developed this learning activity called “The World This Week.” Everyone will rotate to share the latest global news each week. This will also be an important opportunity for you to practice how to carry out a public presentation. 
  * “Me/Us __ the World” Exhibit
In the final class of the course, we will have a mini-exhibit. You could work alone or with others to create _any kinds of artefact_ to present to your classmates. The theme of the exhibit is to consider any relationships you have with the global world in the past or future. I will provide detailed instruction at the beginning of the semester.
  * Study Journal:
Study Journal is a Google document you share with me. I will provide detailed instructions later for how to create your Study Journal. I hope this Study Journal will serve as a platform for you to monitor and track your learning progress. It will also be a good way for me to know how you are doing during these four months and what measures I could do to support your learning. You will be responsible for maintaining this Study Journal throughout the 4-month course. In specific, this Study Journal will include four components.
  1. At the beginning of the course, you will need to develop your learning schedule for all the course assignments stated in the syllabus. (mandatory)
  2. In the 8th week of the course, you will need to do a mid-term reflection to evaluate your learning so far and how you may adjust your study plan in the next two months. (mandatory)
  3. At the end of the course, you will need to write a brief report evaluating your learning during these four months. (mandatory)
  4. You are welcome to write an update on your learning progress and status any time during the semester (e.g., once a week) on the same document. (optional)
