You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict represents a defining moment in 21st-century history, offering the world unprecedented opportunities to advance theoretical understanding, develop innovative methodologies, and contribute to knowledge that will inform policy and practice for decades to come. With such a “critical historical moment”, however, we have learned not only the mass media but also many scholars analysis have continously failed to access critical information so to give insightful views on the undergoing international unrest and international power conflict normally invisible during peacetime. In face of all kinds of biased war infirmation and propaganda, this war therefore provides a unique laboratory but also a challenging task for understanding how political institutions, identities, and relationships stage warfare under extreme duress. This course aims to revisit selected aspects of researches on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, through class discussion and then to develop an insightful approach for understanding the origins of geopolitical tensions, conflict prevention, humanitarian response, and international security. Hopefully the course participants can contribute to evidence-based policy-making and humanitarian practice, providing further research with broader social impact beyond academic circles.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Firstly, students to learn how recent scholarship emphasise the importance of Realist and Liberal theories provide competing explanations for the conflict’s origins and development. Comparative analyses using these frameworks help illuminate different aspects of the war’s causes and conduct.  
Secondly, through learning the phenomenological approaches to own valuable knowledge for studying critical thinking in academic institutions during the war; in addition, students are also expected to check on qualitative thematic analysis has been employed to understand coping strategies among key findings.  
Thirdly, theoretical frameworks such as constructivist approaches offer insights into identity formation and perception-based motivations in the conflict. This theoretical framework emphasises how Russian and Ukrainian identities have shaped the war’s trajectory.  
In addition, students may experience how a proper politico-sociological analysis in understanding the war’s impact on Ukrainian society. Research methodologies include semi-structured interviews with displaced populations, and survey research examining social attitudes during wartime.  
In general, developing expertise in Russia-Ukraine conflict studies positions young scholars at the forefront of an emerging and important academic specialisation. As the conflict’s implications continue to unfold over decades, scholars with deep understanding of its insightful dimensions will be increasingly valuable to academic institutions, policy organizations, and international agencies.
