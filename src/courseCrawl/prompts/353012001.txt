##  課程簡介Course Description
The class discussions will be centered around two papers each session. A brief handout of your presentation should be distributed to the class at the start of class. I also plan to distribute a list of topics and papers that we will not cover in the class. The objective is two fold. First, the financial accounting area is vast and I had to make choices regarding what should and should not be discussed at the class. Second, the list is a good starting point to probe further into any of the areas covered, should you be interested in pursuing those areas for a term paper or a thesis.
A one-page outline will be due in class on Dec. 10. The outline should include your research question, motivation for the question, and the incremental contribution, a sketch of the empirical design, the data required to test the question, and the expected findings. The research proposal submitted on Jan. 5, 2020 would amplify each of these issues in greater detail. The length of the paper (i.e., the body of the paper) should not exceed 15 pages (font size 12), double spaced. Each student is required to present the research idea in class at the end of the semester (I do not require empirical analyses).
