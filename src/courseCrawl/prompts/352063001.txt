##  課程簡介Course Description
This is an advanced and demanding course in investment analysis. The objective of this course is to provide students with key concepts in investment theory from a perspective of rational investors (e.g., portfolio managers) rather than an individual investor. The course aims at developing systematic thoughts to address investment problems. That said, this class is not about the fine art of stock picking or ways to make money in the stock market. The detail analysis on individual firms is outside the scope of the course.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course begins with describing the background for investments, which introduces various investment instruments and the markets where securities are traded. Then we will proceed to discuss the basic asset pricing models (e.g., CAPM and APT) and portfolio management (including portfolio optimization and performance evaluation). We will also study the valuation of typical investment instruments in details. This course is intense and students are expected to participate actively in the class. As this course builds upon your investment course in undergraduate, to maximize acquisition of new knowledge, the instructor will not cover overlapping topics with the investment course but these topics remain examinable.
