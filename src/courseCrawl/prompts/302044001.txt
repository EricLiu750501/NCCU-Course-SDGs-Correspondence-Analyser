##  課程簡介Course Description
The financial service industry plays a significant role in the economy and it continues to undergo dramatic changes. Financial institutions (FIs) perform the essential function and are subject to different risks. The risk management of FIs is crucial not only in maximizing shareholders’ value, but also in ensuring the stability of the whole financial system. In this course, we focus on the measurement and management of fundamental risks of FIs including banks, pension fund and insurance companies. In addition, the regulations on FIs and the impact of climate risk on FIs’management will be covered.
