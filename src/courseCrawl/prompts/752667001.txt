##  課程簡介Course Description
Cultural psychology is the scientific study of how cultures affect the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals. In this course, we will have an in-depth discussion on the theories, concepts, and methods of cultural psychology. We will also discuss how cultures reflect and shape the psychological processes of individuals based on recent empirical research. Topics of this course include self and personality, motivation, cognition and perception, emotions, morality, etc., which are closely linked to other disciplines of psychology such as social psychology, cognitive psychology, and developmental psychology. This course will adopt a seminar approach in which students will take turns to present and lead the in-class discussion based on the assigned readings.
