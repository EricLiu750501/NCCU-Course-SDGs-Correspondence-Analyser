##  課程簡介Course Description
This seminar offers multi-disciplinary perspectives both on institutions and jurisprudence, addressing controversial issues, bridging international and national dialogues, and encouraging students to observe conflicting interests.
⚠️ Important Information:
Languages : The course is part of the NCCU’s program of English as a medium of instruction (EMI) co-organised by the Department of Political Science, the College of Law, and the International College of Innovation. Given students’ pragmatic needs for their future careers, Chinese Mandarin also serves as a supporting language in the running of discussions. However, _language proficiency does NOT affect the evaluation of students' performance_.
Prerequisites : The course is open to all NCCU students. However, before you join this advanced course for both graduates and senior undergraduates, you MUST have completed studies of constitutional law or public international law in a higher education institution and be familiar with fundamental legal concepts and language.
🚨 IF YOU CANNOT ATTEND THE KEYNOTE SPEECH SCHEDULED _FROM 12:10 TO 14:00 ON 4th DECEMBER_ , PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THE COURSE. 🚨

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
International human rights law (IHRL) nowadays constitutes a fundamental element in governance at local, national, and global levels. The implementation of international human rights instruments in Taiwan and the rest of the world urges our students to be prepared for this contemporary challenge to peace, democracy, and the rule of law. 
Method, Requirements, & Assignments
_Our seminar shall be composed of lectures, guided readings, and discussions._

Each student shall become a member of this course communication platform and activate the notification. To join it, please register via https://i.nccu.edu.tw (personal setting) for your NCCU Google Workspace account.
  * Designated readings and rapporteur podcast
Each rapporteur team is composed of at least 2 members of different cultural and disciplinary backgrounds and shall produce an AUDIO file of 20 minutes, in a podcast fashion, to briefly present the designated reading of the week, uploaded 24 hours before the course to our Google Classroom.
This podcast production is an exercise of storytelling without slides or images. Please bear in mind that your task is to make the academic paper or case law as accessible as a fairy tale for kids. 
  * Mid-term oral examination: individual interview session
The presenting order is determined by random number generation 1 week before the examination day.
Before presenting your answer within 5 minutes to the instructor in the examination room, you draw a number to determine your test question and shall have 20 minutes to be prepared; discussions, consultations or references are all allowed during these 20 minutes. Please bear in mind that your oral presentation may be interrupted at any time by additional questions.
  * Term oral examination: moot court session
Rapporteur teams will be regrouped into 4 teams playing in 2 rounds of moot court: applicant council v. respondent State (randomly determined). The case facts and (very simple) oral arguments rules will be published by the end of November via our Google Classroom. 
Invocation/citation of the course jurisprudence is indispensable. No written memorial required.
