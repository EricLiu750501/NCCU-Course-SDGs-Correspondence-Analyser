You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
本課程教學目標為提升中高級華語之深度與廣度，協助學生從句子發展成段落的能力。除了教授語言本體的知識，也關注更寬廣的領域，例如台灣的社會、文化、歷史等知識，並透過實際生活的應用，如校外教學等活動，讓學生能將課堂上之所學實踐於生活中，使其在目標語環境中與他人溝通時，在聽說讀寫方面均能更擴展其所欲表達的思想與意見。
The instructional objective of this course is to enhance the depth and breadth of intermediate high Chinese language proficiency, facilitating students' ability to develop sentences into cohesive paragraphs. In addition to imparting knowledge of the language itself, the course also addresses a broader range of topics, such as Taiwanese society, culture, and history. Through practical application in real-life contexts, such as field trips, students are encouraged to implement their classroom learning into their daily lives. This approach aims to expand their ability to express thoughts and opinions in listening, speaking, reading, and writing within the target language environment, thus improving their communication with others.
