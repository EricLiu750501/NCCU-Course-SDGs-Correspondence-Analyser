You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
How do we really mean what we say—and how can we teach that to language learners? This course explores the intricate relationship between context and meaning in communication, focusing on how pragmatic concepts can be applied to second language acquisition (SLA) and English language teaching. Students will explore key topics such as speech acts, implicature, presupposition, Grice' s Cooperative Principle, politeness strategies, and information packaging (e.g., topic-focus structure and given-new distinctions). Blending theory with practice, the course equips future language educators with the tools to recognize and teach the often-unspoken rules of real-world language use in diverse classroom settings.
