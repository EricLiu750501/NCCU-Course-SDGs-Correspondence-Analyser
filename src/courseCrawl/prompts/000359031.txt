You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

##  課程簡介Course Description
The objective of this course is to provide the students with the essential and fundamental concepts of statistics. The course covers descriptive statistics, basic concepts of probability, random variables, some discrete and continuous distributions, the concept of sampling distributions, and basic statistical inference (point estimation, interval estimation, and hypothesis testing).

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course is designed to introduce college-level students the basic concepts in statistics. In particular, students will learn descriptive statistics, random variables, distributions, and basic statistical inference in this semester. After taking this course, students will demonstrate the ability to perform exploratory data analysis and interpret the results properly; understand the fundamental concepts of random variables and distributions; understand the concepts of population, sample, and statistical inference; be able to make statistical inference from data and draw proper conclusions.
