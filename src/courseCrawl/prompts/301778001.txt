##  課程簡介Course Description
Please note ITS course is NOT an EMI course and is conducted in Mandarin.
This is an online interactive simulation course of international trade. Students in NCCU, FSU (Florida State University College of Law) and SUIBE (Shanghai University of International Business & Economics) will simultaneously participate in the simulated trade transactions with one another. Using a web-based software platform designed just for this course, students will play the roles of virtual trading companies in their respective areas and seek to trade goods between Taiwan/USA and Taiwan/Shanghai.
Trade Simulation, Business Review, Quiz and Board Meeting are the four segments of this course.  
- Trade Simulation
Basically, every 3 students will make up a team and register a virtual company of their own. By browsing the ITS platform, students can be well informed of the domestic and overseas demand and supply, and then to decide what to sell or buy. Facing various situations in the trading environment, students will learn how to acquire competitive advantages, control business risks, so as to maximize trade profits. Gradually, keen market awareness, strong communication skills, good team spirit, rapid response style and logical analysis ability have been trained during the learning-by-doing process. During the simulation, the participants communicate mainly by E-mails with foreign counterparts. Moreover, real-time oral negotiations are conducted via live conference facilities among 3 ends.
- Business Review
During trade simulation, students will have weekly class meetings with the instructors to summarize and self-assess their own operations. The week's transactions will be reviewed, and any problems that cropped up can be analyzed and solved. Besides, effective communications within the team will also be strengthened. 
-Quiz
A couple of quizzes will be held close to the end of the class, so as to find out how much each student has learned from the class.
- Board Meeting  
At the end of simulation, students will write working reports according to their business achievements and submit to the board in advance. On the board meeting, students will give presentations to the board directors, which are composed of professional and experienced people from trading industry, and accept their questions and comments.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
A primary objective of the course is to help students learn how to conduct an international trade transaction. To that end, we will take a hands-on approach. Through simulations accessible in a specially-designed internet environment, you will perform all the major tasks of actual international trade transactions, including 1) finding a seller of a product you want to buy, 2) negotiating the terms of the purchase, 3) arranging for financing, shipping, and insurance, and 4) keeping track of the financial effects of the transaction on your company. We also emphasize a problem-solving approach. You will learn to identify risks and challenges and also how to develop strategies to solve them.
Another objective of the course is to introduce you to future clients and contacts. 
FSU and SUIBE students will soon be staff of important companies which engage in foreign trade. Not only will you meet them through this course, you will also get to know them further through weekly contact with them and learn how to engage them effectively. Building such relationships is of crucial importance to international business.
##  每周課程進度與作業要求 Course Schedule & Requirements
You will negotiate with students from FSU and SUIBE, as well as other buyers and sellers acted by teachers and/or industrial specialists. Communications between student-run trading companies and their clients, and between students and teachers, can occur anytime, via email and/or other communication apps on hand-held devices. Around twenty half-an-hour sessions totally for live video negotiations between the companies will be held. 
Once the simulation program is up and running, NCCU students will meet each week with one or more of the professors in the teaching team. Here the week’s transactions can be discussed and any problems that you share will be analyzed and solved. 
Each student individually is required to email to Professor Su, and Chen (on the dates indicated in Attachment) a work report (述職報告) and a final report(董事會報告) of his or her trading company’s activities. Each of these reports should summarize the efforts and results of your company as a whole, and also of you individually as a trader. Highlight the challenges you encountered and the strategies you used to overcome them, with respect to each of the categories you are graded on, as listed above. You are also required to participate, together with the team from your company, in one to three live video negotiations. These negotiations will be closed to other NCCU students and remain confidential in order to protect your company’s strategies. The final requirement is for each company to give an oral summary, of about 20 minutes in length, of the company’s operations at the end of the semester at our simulated Board meeting.
_Attendance_
What we do in class is crucial to your achieving the goals of the course. For this reason, and in order to comply with the attendance policy of the NCCU, you are expected to attend and participate in each class meeting. Failure to perform live negotiations or to do an oral report at the board meeting may result in failure of the class.
