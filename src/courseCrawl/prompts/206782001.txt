You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course will develop students’ knowledge of the major conceptual approaches for policy transfer and lesson learning in policy-making. Students will critically assess and synthesize the applicability of these concepts for analyzing public policy development in Greater China in the context of an increasingly pluralized world. Major public policy areas (for example, environment, social security, or health care) will be compared in light of the global public policy trends and changing governance models in public policy. Students will apply theories and evidence from other countries and reflect on policy transfer processes to Greater China (Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Macau) to enable them to question policy processes, synthesize knowledge from different places and disciplines, and consider the nature of policy in Greater China.
