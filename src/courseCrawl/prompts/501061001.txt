# 課程簡介 Course Description
ENGLISH ORAL COMMUNICATION AND READING (THREE) is a continuation in classroom 
instruction and experience in oral communication skills, particularly those related to public presentation, group discussion, and more. According to the English Department’s EFL Committee Mission Statement, the goal for students in this course is that they should demonstrate reasonable fluency and pronunciation in standard English. Ability to participate comfortably in general conversation is determined by: Comprehending and responding appropriately, Initiating, continuing, and ending a conversation, Interacting with cultural awareness, Improvising in new situations, Using grammar flexibly, Seeking and providing information in an organized manner, and Narrating an event. The course approaches communication, comprehension, fluency, improvisational language structures, and communication theory. The course will use a great deal of culture-specific materials, such as videos and critical thinking/communication exercises.
This semester’s curriculum incorporates a very strong New Media program in which students will engage in language learning through realia in the form of tabletop roleplaying games, specifically we will utilize the A.C.E. (_Awfully Cheerful Engine_) system as a language learning and practice tool.
This course requires students to use AI extensively as a personal resource to improve their language skills. Students must have an account (free is okay) with Gemini (Google) and/or ChatGPT (OpenAI). You must be familiar with using text and voice modes with the chatbots. Some assignments will require that you video yourself using the resources for language learning/practice activities.
Students will be required to setup an AI English Study Buddy program (you will be taught the principles of doing this; most AI programs have a free tier you can use on PC and/or mobile). You will be asked to practice your English skills with the AI Buddy outside of class as well as complete certain classroom assignments with the AI Buddy.
This semester, we may include a special section on the use of Virtual Reality in communication, narrative form, and media-based discourse construction (pandemic willing).
Depending upon student feedback, we may incorporate a form of a teaching approach known as GAMIFICATION as well as GAMIZATION, using fantasy card, board, and tabletop games in contexts adapted to the language learning classroom. If/when we are holding class online due to pandemic prevention protocols, we use Discord and perhaps Owlbear Rodeo for Virtual Table Top (VTT) sessions. We may also use particular card and board games (again, based upon student feedback).
This course is taught in English in an English environment only. Please note students from outside the English Department who have not taken the prerequisite courses must be able to understand English to an appropriate level for this course.
Obviously, whether we meet in person or online due to pandemic response protocols or other factors will affect some of our course content. Also, obviously, for in-person classes, students must scan the QR code when required (in addition to answering roll call as they are different procedures) and wear a mask while observing social distancing.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
# 課程目標與學習成效 Goals & Learning Outcomes
## 課程目標 Course Objectives
Oral Training Goals : The goal of this semester is to continue to develop competence in using English to present information in informal and formal settings. Students must be able to organize and deliver formal and informal presentations in front of an audience. They should be able to quickly organize an informal presentation when asked to share thoughts, information, or opinions on the spot. When given time to prepare, they should be able to make organized and effective presentations that include the use of visual aids that meet the required guidelines for informative and persuasive speeches.
Reading Goals : The general goal of the course is to improve the students’ ability to converse on subjects in a variety of content areas. Students may also acquire specific knowledge on the hows and whys of constructing specific types of speeches or participate in discussions. The reading component should focus on articles in these and other related subject areas and on readings from speech and communication textbooks. Authentic materials intended for native English speakers will be adopted as the major source of material for student readings.
## 學習成效 Specific Learning Outcomes
This course employs the following: Conversation Blueprints, Improvisational Language Structures, 
Interactive Drama Role Plays, Storytelling, Tabletop Pole Play, Gamification, Panel and Group Discussion, among others. In addition to oral training components, the course has reading components with appropriate assignments to focus on skill sets as outlined in the English Department's program guidelines. Student skill progress will be assessed in general as to how they perform the goal skills within these various activity metrics – particularly in individual speechmaking, discussion-based activities, and communication projects while communication theory and related concepts will be evaluated via exams, quizzes, and performance. As per the oral training guidelines, students will develop and improve the following specific skillsets:
  * Further development of social skills
  * Group discussions of the reading articles
  * Skills for group dynamics, group decision making, and group leadership
  * Presentations of opinions concerning the reading materials
  * Informal and formal speech making
  * Critical thinking skills
  * Expanding and developing vocabulary
Students should prepare an online drive (Google Drive is suggested) to upload to in order submit periodically class video assignments and other homework on it.
## Course Content and Core Ability Items
How the Course Content relates to the Core Ability Items:
To understand, analyze, and synthesize information in English and to fully express oneself and to communicate with others clearly in oral English.
  * To actively and efficiently express an opinion or to discuss a specialized subject for at least ten minutes - students will be asked to research a number of topics as the fodder for various speaking assignments. These will afford students the opportunity to practice expressing opinions based upon critical ideas. Assessment will determine how well students retain comprehension of the material.
  * To make few mistakes in grammar, vocabulary or pronunciation and to converse fluently – obviously, speaking assignments and speeches will afford students the opportunity to express themselves. Conversation activities will afford students the opportunity to practice and improve within a Communicative Language Learning model. 
Assessment will determine how well students retain comprehension of the material.
  * To understand the expressions used different occasions, including daily conversation, broadcasting, speeches, etc. – as part of their instruction in the content of the course, the students will become more aware of register and role as well as be afforded practice opportunities – particularly for formal and semi-formal contexts. Assessment will determine how well students retain comprehension of the material.
  * In routine situations, to provide information and exchange views – the roleplay, simulation, and conversational activities include opportunity to practice the exchange of ideas, information, and views. Assessment will determine how well students retain comprehension of the material.
  * To speak English with ease and fluency - ease will vary from students to student but the included practice in the course should help improve speaking stress issues and improve fluency through practice. Assessment will determine how well students retain comprehension of the material.
  * To be able to hold a fluent conversation for five minutes on a familiar subject – most speaking activities will be above five minutes while formal speeches will typically be around that level. Students will also be given the opportunity for longer speech actions as the course progresses. Assessment will determine how well students retain comprehension of the material.
  * To synthesize oral and written communication for discussion purposes – an important component of the course is readings as well as oral communication. Likewise, students will be asked to write responses and evaluations of their own and classmate performances. Assessment will determine how well students retain comprehension of the material.
  * To synthesize information on given subjects for formal oral presentations – student speeches will always be based upon original research synthesis. Assessment will determine how well students retain comprehension of the material.

Depending upon student feedback, we may incorporate a form of a teaching approach known as GAMIFICATION as well as GAMIZATION, using fantasy card, board, and tabletop games in contexts adapted to the language learning classroom. We would follow a sequence of activities ranging from conversational fantasy card games up through student generated sessions of tabletop roleplaying games such as the AWFULLY CHEERFUL ENGINE (ACE RPG). TRPG may be a component of in-class interaction. If/when we are holding class online due to pandemic prevention protocols, we use Discord and Owlbear Rodeo for Virtual Table Top (VTT) sessions. We may also use particular card and board games (again, based upon student feedback).
