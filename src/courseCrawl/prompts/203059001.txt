##  課程簡介Course Description
This one-semester undergraduate course is a required for Diplomacy-majored students. The subjects to be introduced and studied mostly concentrate on international negotiations that took place between sovereign governments, but negotiations between non-state actors (NSAs) or between state and non-state actors may be included if the cases on the inter-governmental level are rare or if the cases involving the NSAs are suitable for the enhancement of the theory or practice to be touched on. 
In the lecture weeks the instructor first briefs the class the outlines of the assigned readings, followed by one or two mini case studies with some key terminologies or concepts that may not be clearly emphasized or need a further elaboration in the readings. By doing so can the students broaden the scope of their understanding of relevant explanations of and prescriptions for the conduct of international negotiation. 
The reading load is not light at all because most of the assigned readings have to do with lots of concepts, methods, and applications in negotiation that are beyond the students’ past study on international relations. This reflects the fact that one needs an interdisciplinary understanding to explain and analyze cases in international negotiation. One who doesn’t preview the chapters before coming to class may have some hard time realizing the content of the lecture due to the said interdisciplinary nature and the time constraint.
A local or visiting expert will be invited to brief students about some practical aspects of international negotiation. In addition, two panels with a focus on negotiation or conflict management will be included in this semester’s plan – one co-hosted by the Lung Yintai Foundation (龍應台文教基金會) and Department of Diplomacy, and another by the Association of Foreign Relations (對外關係協會) and Department of Diplomacy.
