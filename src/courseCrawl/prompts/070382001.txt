##  課程簡介Course Description
‘Introduction to Political Science’ is a one-semester module for undergraduate students. It aims at (1) presenting the scope and core areas of political science to students, (2) nurturing their abilities to reflect on politics, and (3) developing their abilities to express their analysis and interpretation of politics through coherent arguments. 
The module, therefore, is organised into two major themes: political phenomena and ideas, with a strong emphasis on the theory and history of political science. Apart from the first two weeks that introduce the theme of the module and its historical origins, the module unfolds with (1) the mapping of key political phenomena (week 3-7), before moving onto (2) the essential aspects of politics (week 9-15). To conclude the module, the last two weeks will include an open discussion on the future of political science (week 15) and a three-round debate (week 16).

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
The objectives of the module include (1) familiarising the students with the core analytical or interpretative objects and approaches of political sciences, (2) cultivating the students’ ability to critically thinking about the political environment they find themselves in, and (3) encourage students to form and present their political arguments in public in an debate.
The design of the assignments, including the essay abstract (mid-term), class debate (week 16), and term paper (end of term), aims to help students develop the ability to form coherent and succinct arguments and present them in an articulate, well-informed, academic term paper.
