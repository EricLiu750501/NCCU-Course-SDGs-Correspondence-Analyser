You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
Students will work in teams on selected projects to develop a system that meets the desired objectives. Before implementing the system, they must apply appropriate system analysis methods and project management tools. Detailed specifications and designs should be created carefully, and proper documentation must be maintained throughout the process. The system's code should be uploaded to a public repository, and a code tracking system should be utilized to manage changes. Topics may include security and data analysis. Students should also be familiar with various development tools and programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, Python, as well as databases and machine learning algorithms.
Tools:
  * Web Framework: Python web framework (model/view/control), database system, frontend/backend
  * Distributed Message Broker: open-source message broker
  * Software development: project management, code repository, bug/issue tracking system, documenting system, 
  * Virtualization Environment: virtual machine, virtualized network, automated balancer, Docker
  * Paradigms: Continuous delivery, continuous integration, agile
  * Big Data Platform: Spark, HDFS
