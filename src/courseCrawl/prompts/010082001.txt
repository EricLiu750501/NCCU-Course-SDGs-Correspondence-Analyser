You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course provides an introductory exploration of English phonetics, with a primary focus on articulatory phonetics within the General American (GA) accent. Topics covered include phonetic transcription utilizing the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), speech mechanisms, properties and categorizations of English vowels and consonants, sentence stress, rhythmic patterns, and intonation structures.
In addition to theoretical learning from textbooks, the course integrates practical, hands-on activities aimed at refining students' proficiency in the GA accent. Active engagement in assigned readings, class discussions, and timely submission of assignments are expected of students.
This course is intended to serve as a fundamental stepping stone for academic pursuits and professional development in phonetics and related disciplines. By the end of the course, students will have gained foundational knowledge and practical skills applicable to careers in language teaching, speech pathology, linguistic analysis, and related fields. This knowledge can also support the development of accurate pronunciation and articulation in other foreign languages.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course provides students with foundational knowledge in phonetics, with a focus on articulatory phonetics and International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols. Through detailed examination of various aspects of the General American (GA) accent, students will develop proficiency in understanding and producing this accent. Practical training in speaking the GA accent will be facilitated through reading, listening, and speaking exercises. Additionally, students will learn to analyze vowels and consonants using spectrograms.
Four main tasks are designed to asses students' knowledge of English phonetics and to encourage active use of English in class:
1. Quizzes and exams are designed to evaluate students' understanding of English articulation in both segmental and suprasegmental aspects. The segmental aspect includes places and manners of articulation and spectrogram reading, while the suprasegmental aspect focuses on stress assignment and intonation.
2. Weekly reflections encourage students to review key concepts after each class and provide valuable feedback to help the instructor adjust course materials accordingly.
3. The oral presentation trains students to collaborate efficiently in groups, re-organize textbook content logically, and deliver professional presentations in English.
4. Interactive activities through board games help students build confidence in using English communicatively without overemphasizing grammatical perfection. These activities also promote self-reflection on pronunciation, allowing students to identify areas for improvement to enhance clarity in English speaking.
Upon completion of the course, students will be equipped with essential knowledge and skills applicable to teaching, improving pronunciation, and pursuing careers related to phonetics, e.g., speech pathology and linguistic research.
