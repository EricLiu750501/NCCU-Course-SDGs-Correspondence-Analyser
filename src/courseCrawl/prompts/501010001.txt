##  課程簡介Course Description
This course aims at introducing students to the philosophical, religious, and literary texts that have been read as the foundation of western civilization. Students who want to take this course should come to the first session with the reading for the first week done and be prepared for the quiz. The textbooks and the reading package will be available two weeks before the semester starts. The book can be purchased at the University Bookstore, and the reading package at 馨園影印店(台北市文山區文山區二段119巷2號1樓; 29369521，正門對面屈臣氏旁巷子，可麗餅旁邊). Students who are registered for this course will receive an instruction for their readings through their school emails. Students who are not registered but are considering taking this course should email the instructor for information about the reading or ask questions (chl202@nccu.edu.tw).
For the first half of the semester, students will read various texts of the Greek and Hebrew cultures, including the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament), Greek epics, and Greek drama. The historical contexts of the two cultures will be studied and compared. Plato’s and Aristotle’s perceptions of the universe will be studied along with that of the biblical authors’, and human struggles in both cultures will be examined to highlight how ancient peoples of the West defined their positions in history and beyond.
For the second half of the semester, students will examine how the Romans and Christians adopted and redefined the Hebrew and the Greek cultures and merged them to understand and form their cultural, political, and religious identities. Students will study how the Romans absorbed and reshaped the Greek culture in their epic, philosophy, and poetics and how Christians understood the Hebrew Bible and redefined/reinterpreted many of its key issues in the New Testament. The semester will end with Augustine, who demonstrated how Plato’s philosophy and Cicero’s rhetoric helped understand the Bible and how such a new understanding helped him reposition his life.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
In this introductory survey course, students will learn to read and interpret these texts and understand important cultural issues of the West. Students will examine what people of the western world before the Middle Ages thought of their relationships with God/goddesses/gods, with the universe, with nature, with people in and outside their communities, and with themselves. Students will also examine the key issues of the Hebrew, Classical, and Christian cultures, such as the problem of tribulations, the meanings of life, goodness and evil, and the cultivation of a cultural identity and shared values. It is hoped that through a close reading of these foundational texts, students will learn to read complex texts in their cultural and historical contexts and become aware of the complexity of the embedded arguments. It is also hoped that through an understanding of these foundational texts, students will be able to better understand later important religious, philosophical, and literary texts of the West.
##  每周課程進度與作業要求 Course Schedule & Requirements
