##  課程簡介Course Description
This course develops students’ advanced listening and speaking skills in Thai through the thematic lens of Thai food culture. Using authentic media—including documentaries, interviews, food vlogs, and cultural discussions—students will explore issues of regional identity, class, globalization, and social meaning as expressed through cuisine. The course also incorporates critical listening strategies, debate, opinion sharing, and formal presentation skills. In the second half of the semester, students will design and conduct a small-scale survey project in Taiwan related to course topics (e.g., perceptions of Thai food), and present their findings in Thai.
