You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course will focus on the recent developments of Explainable and Safe AI. Explainable AI refers to a family of machine learning and analysis techniques that produce human-understandable machine learning models without sacrificing too much expressive power and prediction accuracy. For existing black box models, Explainable AI aims to generate post-hoc explanations capturing the cause and effect within the decision process of the model. Safe AI explores approaches to produce machine learning models that are robust to environmental noise and adversarial attacks. For trained models, Safe AI assesses if the model is stable and free of vulnerabilities. Explainable and Safe AI has been playing a critical role in realizing the ultimate goal of Trustworthy AI: artificial intelligence that is lawful, ethically adherent, and technically robust in each stage of its lifecycle, from design to development, deployment, and practice.
