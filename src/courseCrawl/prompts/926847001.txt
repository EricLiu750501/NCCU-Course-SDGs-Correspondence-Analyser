You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course focuses on the principles of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a way of analyzing and understanding society. GIS is a tool to provide geospatial information analysis and display results. Industry-standard GIS software will be used in this course. Students learn the concepts of spatial analysis with GIS; use techniques in importing and creating spatial and attribute data; recognize critical components of cartography to design maps, and build attribute and spatial queries for problem-solving based on spatial relationships. Laboratory exercises incorporate the use of GIS software (ArcGIS) in the analysis of social issues.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
The objectives of the course are to acquaint graduate students with methods to analyze spatially-referenced data with the procedures appropriate for a social science’s theoretical base. The course contact hours are organized into three major foci: (a) essential theoretical concepts and the constituent reference to Census Bureau demography; (b) the visualization of social data facilitated by Geographic Information Systems software; and (c) techniques to construct or analyze social point, line, and polygon data using exploratory and confirmatory spatially centered procedures to actual social theories and data using a pedagogical analytical approaches. Weekly readings and homework will emphasize applications of these procedures to actual social theories and data using a pedagogical model of application, interpretation, and presentation of empirical analyses by students. The semester-length project is a key instrument by which students will demonstrate competence in spatial analysis methods covered in the course.
