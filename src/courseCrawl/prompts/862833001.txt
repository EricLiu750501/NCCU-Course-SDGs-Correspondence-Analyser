##  課程簡介Course Description
Course description
Since the 1980s, most countries in Latin America have left behind a long history of harsh authoritarian rule and became electoral democracies. Despite this remarkable achievement, political institutions remain fragile, economic development uncertain, and the reduction of social inequality is still in the making. In short, citizenship remains “low intensity.” This course is an introduction to the politics of democratization and development in the region. The main question to be addressed is: How are different countries facing the challenge of consolidating democracy and achieving development with social justice? The course will survey theories of democracy and development to explain the recent history and current situation of the region.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Objectives
The main objective of the course is to provide students a general panorama of the dilemmas countries in Latin America face to establish political democracies that are socially inclusive. To do so the course will provide theoretical and analytical tools as well as empirical background to help students identify, describe, explain and compare these dilemmas. 
A second objective of this course is to challenge participants and turn their minds into “social scientists wavelength” so as to learn how to ask research questions the same way they do. 
A third and final objective of this course is to help students fine-tune their writing and oral presentation skills. At the end of this course, the expectation is that all participants will be able to give a concise, analytical, comparative, and critical presentation of a country-case study.
With this in mind, the course consists of three parts. Part I addresses the main topics of this course theoretically. We will discuss definitions of democracy and development. Part II deals with the successes and failures of democracy and development in Latin America during most of the XX Century. Part III will focus on the most pressing issues Latin American countries are facing since the1980s to consolidate democracy with social justice. In Part III we will address issues of institutional weakness, poverty and inequality, (un)rule of law, and the dangers of authoritarian regressions.
