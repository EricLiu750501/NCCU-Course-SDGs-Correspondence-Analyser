  1. Attendance and Participation
  * If you are unable to attend a class, you must notify the professor via email before the class begins. Upon your return, you are required to provide valid documentation to formalize your absence. Alternative methods, such as having a friend inform the professor about your illness, will not be accepted. Leave requests must be supported by legitimate reasons; excuses such as travel or taking a driver’s license test will not be considered valid.
  * Attendance will be monitored. Arriving late to class will result in a one-point deduction from your final grade. Missing an entire class will incur a two-point deduction. Students who accumulate three absences will automatically fail the course.
  1. Late Work Policy
  * 1 day late (i.e., immediately after the deadline up to 24 hours later): -10%
  * 2 days late (i.e., 24 to 48 hours after the deadline): -25%
  * 3 days late (i.e., 48 to 72 hours after the deadline): -50%
  * 3 days late: -100% (I will not grade the assignment.)
  1. Team Photo and Peer Evaluation
  * Each team for the term project will consist of five students.
  * Teams are required to submit a group photo that includes the team number and the names of all members. A bonus point will be added to the final grade for teams that submit their photo on time.
  * At the end of the semester, a peer evaluation process will take place. Your final grade may be adjusted based on the results of these evaluations. Poor peer evaluation scores, particularly when compared to high-performing teammates, may result in failing the course. This highlights the importance of active, consistent participation and meaningful contributions to the team's efforts, both in class and outside of it.
