##  課程簡介Course Description
This course examines the development of Gothic fiction from the mid-18th-century to the early Victorian period. The eight decades separating Horace Walpole’s _The Castle of Otranto_ (1764) and Charlotte Brontё’s _Jane Eyre_ (1847) witness a proliferation of novels with strong Gothic character. Together they consolidate and complicate the meaning of the Gothic. We will read several scholarly essays about the Gothic and discuss intriguing passages from seven major texts in the history of British Gothic fiction.
