You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course provides a thorough introduction to machine learning with Python, serving as both a step-by-step tutorial and a lasting reference as you develop your own machine learning systems. It delves into essential supervised learning techniques, covering foundational concepts and practical application of Python libraries to build robust models and applications.
This course includes 8 modules, which requires a total of 48 hours of class meetings over the sixteen-week period. You should plan to devote approximately 12 hours each week to complete the activities and assignments required in this course.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
We will begin with fundamental machine learning models, such as regression for predicting continuous outcomes, Naive Bayes classifiers, binary logistic classification, and the SVM (support vector machine). Then, we’ll move on to non-parametric models like decision trees and random forests. Additionally, we’ll cover key topics such as data preprocessing, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
The Python libraries featured in this course include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn (sklearn). You'll also be introduced to sentiment analysis—a subfield of natural language processing (NLP)—using the nltk library, learning to classify documents with machine learning algorithms.
Students should treat this course as a prerequisite for the upcoming course 「深度學習與大型語言模型之會計應用」 (offered next semester), as it covers the foundational knowledge necessary for understanding deep learning and large language models (LLMs).
##  每周課程進度與作業要求 Course Schedule & Requirements
The following schedule shows topics, readings, and due dates by module (usually two weeks per module). All assignments and activities are subject to change. These changes may be announced at any regularly scheduled class meeting or in the learning management system.
