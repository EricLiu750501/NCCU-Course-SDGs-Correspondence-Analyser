##  課程簡介Course Description
(This syllabus is required by the school administrators; the class will proceed based on the syllabus and announcement published on the course web page.)
Public finance is a field of economics mainly concerned with government (or other collective organizations') activities and the associated economic effects. The understanding of government activities and the associated economic effects helps in the design and administration of public policies. The field is often divided into questions of what the government should do or are doing (expenditure side), and questions of how to pay for those activities (revenue side).
- On the expenditure side, one may classify government expenditures into three main types. Government purchases of goods and services for current use are classed as government consumption. Government purchases of goods and services intended to create future benefits---such as infrastructure investment or research spending---are classed as government investment. Government expenditures that are not purchases of goods and services, and instead just represent transfers of money---such as social security payments---are called transfer payments. The associated effects of various government expenditures on economic incentives and on the distribution of income, wealth, and/or consumption are the focus of expenditure-side studies.
- On the revenue side, government financing can be achieved by taxes, debts (government borrowing), asset sales, earnings made by public enterprises, seigniorage, and/or other means. How a government chooses to finance its activities must have effects on the distribution of income, wealth, and/or consumption, and on the efficiency of markets. The main theme of this course on the revenue side is taxation. The issue of how taxes affect income and wealth distribution is the focus of tax incidence studies; the issue of how taxes affect efficiency performance is the focus of efficient taxation studies. In addition, revenue side studies also analyze the effects of various types of taxes and types of borrowing as well as administrative concerns, such as tax evasion and enforcement.
In addition to the term "public finance", a broader term—public economics—and a narrower term—government finance—are also used often. As a late comer, the public choice school to public finance becomes somewhat popular from the 80's. It seeks to explain how self-interested voters, politicians, and bureaucrats actually operate, rather than how they should operate.
