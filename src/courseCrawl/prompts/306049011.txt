##  課程簡介Course Description
Description:   
First programming course for MIS majors, designed for students with little or no programming expe-rience. Emphasizes basic principles and concepts of object-oriented programming using JAVA. Top-ics include classes, interfaces, operators, program control, arrays, testing, debugging, inheritance, and polymorphism; Techniques for simplifying the programming process and improving code quality; Features activity-based learning with ample opportunities to implement interesting programs. 
Keys to success:   
Success is much more dependent on personal discipline than programming experience or raw intellect. There is a high probability of earning a B or higher if you do the following: Approach the course with the attitude and work ethic of an IT professional; Prepare for and attend every class; Start assignments early and fulfill all requirements. You should allocate 10 hrs/week for this course!
