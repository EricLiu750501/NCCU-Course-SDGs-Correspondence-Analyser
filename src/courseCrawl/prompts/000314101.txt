##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course is designed to provide you with an in-depth understanding of the subject covered by the materials: fundamental financial accounting. The nature of this course is demanding and challenging. It is time-consuming for a college freshman to master the subject while trying to get used to the newly-started college life at the same time. To succeed, you need to devote serious efforts outside of class. Come to each class prepared. 
The course materials are presented through a mix of class lectures, assigned readings, and problems. You should maximize your understanding of the materials by attending and participating in class lectures and discussions. To be successful, you are expected to do the following: 
  1. read the assigned readings and be prepared before you come to the class. 
  2. arrive on time. 
  3. be actively involved in class by asking questions and participating in discussions. 
  4. review the assigned readings and attempt all homework problems after the class. 
After you have done everything you are expected to do, if you still have difficulties with the materials after we discuss in class, my office hours are available for you.
Important Notes and Policies
  1. Exams must be taken as scheduled. No makeup exam will be given under any circumstances. 
  2. Leaving classroom without permission during the exam will be penalized.
  3. Proper classroom manners at all times is expected. 
  4. Turn off your cell-phone during the class session.
