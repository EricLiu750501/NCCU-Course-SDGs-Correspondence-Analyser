Description
This course is an introduction to the empirical research of comparative politics. Through thematic discussions of theory-driven research on various issues of Latin American politics, the questions we address in this course include: What leads to regime change? Why do some countries achieve a higher level of economic development than others? Why do some political parties successfully adapt to the changing environment while others collapse? Why do some countries experience more protests while other countries do not? Why does China dominate infrastructure development in some countries but not others? To address these questions, we use analytical tools and theoretical orientations provided by political science and Latin American studies.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Objectives
The objective of this course is twofold. First, it helps students learn about issues and comparative politics approaches. Second, it helps students prepare for their thesis/dissertation proposals on topics about comparative politics. This course is divided into two sessions. The first session (Week 1 to Week 4) provides intensive training for students to get familiar with the elements of empirical research design, which is the basis for completing the required assignments for this course. The second session (Week 5 to Week 15) comprises seminars for empirical research papers about Latin American politics. The training helps students enhance their ability to wrestle with different ideas, read empirical papers effectively, and compose thoughtful literature reviews for their thesis/dissertation proposals.
By the end of this semester, students will be able to: 
1. Apply empirical theories to analyze various political issues facing Latin American countries.
2. Conduct critical reviews of empirical political studies.
3. Propose reasonable research questions in comparative politics and develop a well-structured, theoretically relevant, methodologically sound research plan to address these questions.
