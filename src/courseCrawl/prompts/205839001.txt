##  課程簡介Course Description
本課程旨在培養學生深入理解並實踐永續發展策略。我們將引導對相關商業模式、社會企業、非營利組織運作或政策推動 抱有熱情的學員，探索永續發展在商業與非商業領域(例如非營利組織或政策倡議等) 多元策略與應用。
課程將區分為兩部分。  
第一部分在於探討各界如何透過系統性變革，共同應對全球性的永續挑戰，包括氣候變遷、平等、貧窮 等議題。我們將聚焦於如何整合”環境（Environmental）、社會（Social）與治理（Governance, ESG）”等關鍵要素，以實現聯合國永續發展目標 (SDGs)。
第二部分將討論永續商業模式及策略 。本學期將永續商業模式重心放在"循環經濟"及"社會企業"兩個模組。於”循環經濟”模組將邀請實務講者、公司參訪及鼓勵同學參加循環經濟相關論壇。於”社會企業”模組將安排學生到南萬華(大加蚋)的社會企業與非營利組織參訪，了解南萬華的社會議題(包含貧窮、新移民、不平等)。
This advanced course in "Sustainable Development and Local Revitalization" is designed to give you a deep understanding of sustainability strategies and how to put them into practice. If you're passionate about business models, social enterprises, non-profit operations, or policy advocacy related to sustainability, this course will help you explore various approaches in both commercial and non-commercial sectors (like non-profits or policy advocacy).
At its core, the course examines how different groups can work together through systemic change to tackle global sustainability challenges. This includes pressing issues such as climate change, the circular economy, equality, and poverty. We'll focus on how to integrate key elements of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Course Structure
The course is divided into two main parts:
Part One focuses on how various sectors can collaborate through systemic change to address global sustainability challenges. This includes pressing issues such as climate changes, equality, and poverty. We'll explore case studies that demonstrate how key Environmental, Social, andGovernance (ESG) factors are successfully leveraged to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Part Two delves into sustainable business models and strategies. This semester, our focus will be on two core modules: Circular Economy and Social Enterprise. The Circular Economy module will feature insights from guest speakers from industry, include company visits, and encourage student participation in relevant forums. For the Social Enterprise module, students will visit social enterprises and non-profit organizations in Nan-Wanhua (Dajiali) to gain firsthand understanding of local social issues, including poverty, new immigrant integration, and inequality.
