##  課程簡介Course Description
This course focuses on examining different legal methods that have been developed in the international legal society, such as law and economics, critical legal studies, and constitutionalism, etc. With basic understandings of these legal methodologies, students are expected to analyze relevant cases adjudicated under the World Trade Organization (WTO) from both a theoretical and practical perspective. 
Unlike general legal method courses offered by law schools, this course is especially designed for graduate students of the Department of International Business with the aim to equip them the necessary analytical tool for further study of international economic law. Therefore, this course places more emphases on the legal research and analysis of international economic law (especially the WTO regime) than those on general legal reasoning and interpretation methodologies covered by ordinary legal method courses.
