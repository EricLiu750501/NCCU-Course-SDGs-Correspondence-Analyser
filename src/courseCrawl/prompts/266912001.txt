##  課程簡介Course Description
貿易政策的議題，在傳統上，是聚焦在政府應否對外開放其本國的自由貿易、或應否對貿易作某種管制的討論上。而無論哪一種政策工具，一旦施行，便不可避免地會國際市場的供需產生或多或少的影響，也因此會影響到貿易的價格、貿易的數量、國內的生產、國內的消費、乃至所得分配等等的面向，而最終也將會影響到社會福利。
The issues of trade policy are traditionally focused on whether the government should open its domestic market, or whether certain types of restrictions should be implemented. Once implemented, any type of trade policy tool will inevitably more or less affect the demand and supply of international market, and hence affect the prices and quantities of trade, domestic consumption, and income distribution, among others, and at last affect the social welfare.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
本課程以貿易理論為其基礎，以探討貿易政策在國際貿易各個面向中的角色，及其最終對社會福利的影響。在學習完本課程後，你將可以：  
一：瞭解政府干預國際貿易的動機，並理解各類的干預手段諸如關稅、配額、出口補貼、出口自動設限等的運作機制。  
二：瞭解開發中國家及工業化國家兩類國家常見的貿易政策，並明白其利弊得失。  
三：瞭解世界貿易組織對國際貿易的規範，及其對本國的影響。另外也會能瞭解國際上最流行的區域貿易協定的議題。
This course explores, on the basis of the theories of trade, the role of trade policies in various aspects of international trade, and their effects on social welfare. The content of this course can be divided into three parts:
1. I will first talk about the government’s incentives to intervene in international trade, and then introduce various policy tools such as tariffs, quotas, export subsidies, VER (Voluntary Export Restraint), and so on.  
2. I will introduce common trade policies implemented by developing and developed countries, and discuss their pros and cons.  
3. I will talk about some rules set by the WTO for international trade, and discuss their effects on domestic country. Other issues frequently discussed recently such as regional free trade agreement (FTA) will also be mentioned if time allows.
