##  課程簡介Course Description
This course tries to explore the correlation between social identity and language use within the multicultural and multilingual society of Taiwan, by means of an interdisciplinary approach, not limited to social psychology, communication, and linguistics. With the advance of various media platforms and discourses, certain learner-centered teaching practices, such as reading guide, panel discussion, independent study, and learning portfolio, are adopted to help students examine their own experience of identity formation and language acquisition, define the identity-language correlation, and then build up a more culturally, linguistically diverse and friendly media environment for Taiwan.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Through the lenses of various social minorities and corresponding language issues in Taiwan’s media, this course expects learners to understand those critical determinants that shape social identity and language use on various levels, and to account for the potential correlation between the two attributes, namely how social identity impacts language use and how language use reveals social identity. By actively engaging in class discussions, assigned tasks, and individual reflections, learners should be able to (i) acquire better understanding of ideology-related conflict and language choice from an individual level, nationwide, to across the border, (ii) develop sensitivity to various minority topics and word choices, and (iii) help themselves assess their own identity development and language attitude. With these learning objectives achieved, they are expected to be better qualified for taking on media practices, enhancing cultural diversity and multilingualism in Taiwan’s media.
##  每周課程進度與作業要求 Course Schedule & Requirements
This course generally divides into three dimensions to examine the correlation between social identity and language use: (i) intrapersonal level, referring to individual experience of first and second language acquisition, (ii) interpersonal level, referring to language attitude toward various social minorities, and (iii) public level, referring to controversial language issues. On the intrapersonal level, the theory of social identity and the sociolinguistic parameters of language attitude are introduced first, followed by the case studies on first and second language acquisition to help learners conceptualize how social identity and language use are correlated through their own experience. The case studies of first and second languages might vary from Mandarin Chinese, Hakka, Southern Min (Taiwanese), indigenous languages, to other Asian languages and foreign languages, depending on each leaner’s identity and choice. Among all these interests, Mandarin Chinese and English are going to be highlighted. On the interpersonal level, Taiwan’s first residents (indigenous peoples), early immigrants (Southern Min and Hakka), and new residents (migrant workers and expatriates) account for the case studies on social identity and language ideology. On the public level, other social minorities (gender minority, ageism, and people with physical/ mental impairment) and speech freedom are focused. Based on the framework of social identity theory and language ideology, learners are required to understand key terms and critical implications, to discuss about relevant cases from various media contexts, and to reflect their own language use and attitude.
