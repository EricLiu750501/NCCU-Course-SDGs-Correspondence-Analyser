##  課程簡介Course Description
Statistics is the art and science of using sample data to make generalization about populations. This course is the first in a two-semester sequence (Statistics I & Statistics II) that aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental statistics and the basic concepts of data analysis. It is intended for undergraduate students who either have no prior statistics courses, or who wish to review the fundamentals before taking additional advanced statistics courses. The core topics in this semester will include descriptive statistics, basic concepts of probability, type of distributions, confidence interval, and hypothesis testing for one-sample problems. Note that the "Course Schedule & Requirements" provided below are subject to change depending on the actual progress of the class. (註： 本課程為中文授課。每週教學內容與課程進度，會依實際授課狀況做調整!)
