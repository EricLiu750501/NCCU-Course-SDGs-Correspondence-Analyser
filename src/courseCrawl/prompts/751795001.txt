You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the theory and applications of renewal processes. Topics include the fundamentals of renewal processes, renewal fucntion, renewal equation, renewal theory and related distributions. The course will include both theoretical concepts and practical examples, and students will gain experience in analyzing and solving problems related to renewal processes.
This is an EMI course, in which English is used as the primary language for teaching and learning.
Prerequisites : Calculus, proability theory, stochastic processes and differential equations.
