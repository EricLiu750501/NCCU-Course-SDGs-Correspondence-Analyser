##  課程簡介Course Description
*PLEASE NOTE that this course is not actually being offered during the fall semester of 2021 (110-1). Due to insufficiencies in the course description platform and/or its utilization, as well as the apparent failure of university regulations to reflect the actual needs of the university's various programs, this summer course is being listed for this fall term even though it is clearly not going to be offered at this time. It is a summer course, and registration for it was closed even before the instructor was forced (by the aforementioned regulations) to input this course description into the system. The instructor apologizes for any inconvenience or misunderstanding that this may cause.*
The goals of this course all involve giving working teachers an opportunity to investigate the methods and difficulties of using Shakespeare's works—and, by extension, the works of other major authors—in their English language courses. Specifically, these goals include:
  * familiarizing teachers with relevant literary and historical background to Shakespeare's works
  * familiarizing teachers with resources such as dictionaries, reference works, films and videos, and web sites for future reference
  * gaining detailed knowledge of several of Shakespeare's works that would be of especially interest to maturing students
  * developing the reading and writing skills necessary to classroom flexibility and confidence in dealing with challenging texts
  * identifying and overcoming textual difficulties
  * practicing incorporating some of Shakespeare's works into existing curricula
  * developing classroom activities based on Shakespeare's works
