##  課程簡介Course Description
Have you ever wondered where the raw materials for the machines and energy production that enable our easy lifestyle come from? Are you aware of how the ongoing exploitation and extraction of natural resources stems from past colonialism and continues to impact the lives of people and communities throughout the globe? The land and resources of these marginalized groups were and are continuously being grabbed to generate or store energy for the rising power demand, which was necessary to support the economic development and technological advancement of global capitalism. 
This course utilises anthropological studies to examine the exploitation of natural resources, the manufacture of renewable energy, and related development issues. This course starts with an introduction to the anthropology of the extractive sector and energy. The course is then divided into two main sections: natural resources (including land, forests, water, and minerals) and energy (such as oil, solar, gas, wind, and nuclear power). In contrast to the prevailing capitalist viewpoint, this course includes discussions on energy democracy and community-based resource governance aimed at achieving a more sustainable future. This course also selects reading materials from Taiwan and around the world to help students gain a deeper understanding of important issues in the two distinct yet interconnected contexts. This course aims to cultivate students' critical thinking abilities and equip students with the necessary knowledge to evaluate the social, cultural, and environmental impacts resulting from the global prevalence of extractive industries and the increasing of energy consumption driven by global capitalism.
