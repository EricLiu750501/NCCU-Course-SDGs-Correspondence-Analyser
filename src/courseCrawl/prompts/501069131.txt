You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course builds on students' existing academic writing and reading skills to further enhance their proficiency. The writing component emphasizes logical reasoning and guides students through the process of developing a short research paper. The reading component focuses on strengthening critical thinking and analytical skills, which students will apply both to published texts and their own writing. Through in-class exercises and writing workshops, students will refine their written English, developing a more effective and polished writing style. They will also grow as critical readers, learning to recognize different writing styles and offer constructive feedback. By the end of the course, students will be able to revise and edit their work more effectively through self-reflection and develop a deeper appreciation for the choices involved in the writing process.
