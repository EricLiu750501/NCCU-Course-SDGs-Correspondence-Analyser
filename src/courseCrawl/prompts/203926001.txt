##  課程簡介Course Description
With a growing confrontation of Sino-US strategic tit-for-tat and globalization versus de-globalization, the globe has become more complext than ever. As a result, the world economy has become fragmented and global power landscape is shifting in a big way. Taught in English, this course attempts to offer an innovative way to examine current global politics and economy. It is designed to grant students basic knowledge and analytical tools for the understanding and explanation of the foreign policies in a comparative way. The course begins with the introduction of comparative analysis, including why to compare, what to compare and how to compare. Then, the evolution of comparative analysis approach including main paradigms and models will be explored in depth. Discussion comprises how states formulate and implement their foreign policies in general and why nations act differently. By examining literature on foreign policy it will look into rational state actors, institutional, societal, and psychological models. The course will debate government decision-makers, organizations, political parties, private interests, social groups, and mass public that have an impact on foreign policy. It analyzes the various constraints within which each of these sets of actors must operate, the nature of their interactions with each other and with the society as a whole, and the processes and mechanisms through which they resolve their differences and formulate policy.
