You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This graduate-level intensive course is delivered in English and conducted on-site at Korea University in Seoul, Korea. Designed as a study-abroad learning experience, the course introduces students to the application of quantitative approaches in the field of education. It focuses on exploring key research questions in educational studies and supports students in developing the ability to interpret and critically evaluate empirical research based on quantitative data. The course provides a foundational understanding of research design and statistical reasoning, while emphasizing the practical application of quantitative methods to real-world educational issues. Through integrated, hands-on activities, students will strengthen their capacity as reflective and competent educational researchers within a global academic context.
