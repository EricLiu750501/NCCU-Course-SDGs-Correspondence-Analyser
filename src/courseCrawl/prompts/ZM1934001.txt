You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
The goals of the course are threefold: First, understand the seminal constructs in digital games. In addition, be familiar with related research published in “flagship” journals including Journal of Communication, Communication Research, Human Communication Research. Mainstream journals dedicated digital games including Media Psychology, Journal of Computer Mediated Communication, New Media and Society, Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, and Computers in Human Behavior. Second, be able to critically analyze and interpret how scholars in these fields frame research issues and investigate the effects of these two media on human being. Third, be able to build logical and precise argument to contribute to advance the knowledge of these two fields, theoretically and empirically. All students should be able to propose a clear-designed, well-argued research proposal at the end of the semester.
Criteria/Requirements:
_For graduate students_ : Research paper is expected for graduate students as the term projects. You are welcome to do the term project individually or with a group of other students. In addition, graduate students have to prepare to the lead the course discussion and summarize the papers assigned for readings. Please use lots of examples/news stories to link to the theory.
_For undergraduate students_ : You can choose to do literature review in chosen topic or design a game (exergame, advergame, serious game, VR game) for your term project. You are welcome to do the term project individually or with a group of other students. You are expected to engage in course discussion, and try to learn to do the course leading.
