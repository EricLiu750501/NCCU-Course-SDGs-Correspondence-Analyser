##  課程簡介Course Description
Course Description:
Over the last two decades, accompany with the rise of China, the Asia-Pacific region has witnessed fierce strategic competition between the United States and China. The regional structure of international relations has dramatically changed and overshadowed by the change of geopolitics as a result. 
Based on interdisciplinary exercise, this course will examine the impacts of geopolitics and competition of technology on the Asia-Pacific. The Asia Pacific is now the center of global economic power house and of advanced technology development. It has become focal points for competition of power politics, especially between two superpowers. Since the Trump Administration started trade war against China in 2018, strategic competition becomes prevailing in overall US-China relations. Among others, technology competition is the most pressing issue and regarded as the top priority of policy agenda today. 
This course will go through global geopolitical uncertainty, the change of geopolitical structure in the Asia Pacific region, US-China strategic competition, the impacts of technology competition, and the challenge to global supply chain in the region. In addition, under the context of US-China strategic competition, Taiwan’s critical role in the hi-technological sectors of global supply chain would be examined.
