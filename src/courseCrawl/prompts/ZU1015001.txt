You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course introduces the full process of data science, from collecting raw data to building useful insights and models. Students will learn how to gather data from sources like websites and APIs, clean and prepare it for analysis, and label image or text data when needed. The course covers key steps in data science, including data wrangling, exploration, visualization, modeling, and evaluation.
In the image section, students will learn how to label and explore image data, apply clustering techniques like K-means to group visual patterns, and understand how to move from basic clustering to using pre-trained models for classification. For each method, students will learn how to evaluate performance using metrics such as accuracy and Intersection over Union (IoU).
In the text section, the course begins with text cleaning and basic techniques like TF-IDF. Students will then explore more powerful models like BERT, and learn how different models can be used for classification and language understanding tasks. Along the way, students will compare results using standard evaluation metrics.
Rather than focusing only on model training, this course emphasizes how to use data to answer real questions, communicate findings, and build end-to-end data science workflows. Students will use Python tools such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Hugging Face Transformers to work on real datasets and complete hands-on projects.
This course is designed for students with basic Python and AI knowledge who want to deepen their understanding of the data science pipeline.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course aims to help students understand the full process of data science, from collecting and preparing data to building and evaluating models. Students will learn how to handle different types of data, including text and images, and apply both basic and advanced techniques such as K-means clustering, TF-IDF, and BERT. By the end of the course, students will be able to use Python tools to explore data, label datasets, apply machine learning models, and evaluate results using metrics like accuracy and IoU. They will also complete a small project to apply what they have learned in a real-world context.
