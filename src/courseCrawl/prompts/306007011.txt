##  課程簡介Course Description
The latest information is in our class website: https://sites.google.com/view/mikehsiao/teaching/networking-2025
Business Data Communication is a mandatory course exclusively intended for senior students majoring in Management Information Systems. Only students majoring in MIS, including those with a double major, are eligible to participate in this course. Students from other departments, IMBA students, and exchange students are kindly requested to unregister from this class.
This course offers an introductory overview of essential principles related to the design and implementation of computer communication networks, protocols, and applications. The topics covered include layered network architecture, the physical layer, data link protocols, network layer design, transport protocols, routing protocols, and network applications. Illustrative examples will be drawn from the Internet TCP/IP protocol suite. Moreover, the course incorporates various programming assignments (previous coding experience is a prerequisite), allowing students to gain practical skills in basic network programming and the development of simple network applications.
