You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course takes a data-driven approach to making investment decisions. The first part will review financial market basics, essential mathematical tools (linear algebra, constrained optimization), statistical methods (linear regression, simulation), Excel spreadsheets, and Python programming (NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas) for investment analysis. The second part will introduce the quantitative investment framework: (i) data collection, (ii) input estimation, (iii) portfolio optimization, (iv) back-testing, (v) implementation, and (vi) performance evaluation. Students will learn how to apply financial theories in portfolio choice (MPT) and asset pricing (CAPM). For practical topics, the course will cover topics on the fund industry, passive investment, active portfolio management, factor investing, performance metrics, style analysis, and risk management.
Students should have a good background in mathematics and statistics (e.g. matrix operations, univariate calculus, normal distribution, hypothesis testing). Prior knowledge in programming (e.g. Python, R, Excel VBA, Matlab, etc.) is desirable but not required. Students without the aforementioned knowledge should expect a steep learning curve and heavy workload.
