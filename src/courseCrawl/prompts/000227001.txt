##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
The main objective of this course is to get students closer to the understanding of International Relations, from different theoretical perspectives, as well as in relevant sub-areas of study. From the introduction of mainstream theories and the alternative theoretical approaches from recent decades, to important themes such as conflict, war, institutions, security, development, environmentalism, among others, students will be able to better comprehend the diversity of opinions and explanations behind those issues. 
Throughout the semester, students are required to read the indicated chapters from the main course book, as well as trying to read the recommended supplementary materials. Each session will consist of three hours. For the first couple of hours, the instructor will provide a lecture on the main ideas and concepts for the selected topic of the day. The third hour will be devoted to interactive activities, occassionally combined with a team-based presentation prepared by students on specific study cases. It is expected that through these activities, students can also improve their critical thinking, oral and writing presentation skills.
