You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This advanced undergraduate course covers the fundamental principles of investment with emphases on theories and applications. The first part of the course will give an overview of the financial market and discuss optimal portfolio choice under the modern portfolio theory. We will then discuss the equilibrium implications of optimal portfolio choice and derive the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Next, we will look into the arbitrage pricing theory (APT) and factor investing. The last part will include topics on other asset classes, performance evaluations, and risk management.
We will extensively use Python to analyze financial data and backtest portfolio strategies. There is no pre-requisite for taking the course, but students are expected to have strong background knowledge in statistics and calculus.
This course is more difficult and demanding than the Data-driven Investment Analysis course offered in the same semester.
