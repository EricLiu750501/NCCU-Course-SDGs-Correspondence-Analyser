You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
###### Human security is a new interdisciplinary topic that originates from two groups of literature: human rights and international security. The first group is full of practitioners and theorists who care about justice, humanity, and equality, mainly defending human rights in the developing world. The second group gathers the best minds of security experts, policy-makers, and strategic analysts who are dedicated to defend the peace, stability, and sustainability of the world, which, arguably, relies on the actions of the developed world. This somehow chaotic and self-contradictory nature makes this topic one of the most fascinating and debatable developments in the IR field. 
###### The main methods used in this class are _cooperative_ and _self-directed_ learning. Therefore, our meetings are designed to be participatory and interactive. If you are uncomfortable with this seminar-style discussion and project-based learning environment, choose other traditional IR courses instead (P.S. If you are unfamiliar with what I just mentioned, you should give this course a try). Also, this course is listed in UCCU’s Micro Program for Sustainability (永續微學程), and participants are encouraged to explore the opportunities of applying related credit programs, service-learning programs, or the newest University Bachelor's Degree (校學士) program.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Students here will first learn various definitions and theories from two sub-disciplines. Then, they will be introduced to case studies in two very different worlds. The final goal is to help students build their perspectives on selected issues: human rights, just war, humanitarian issues, trade and immigration, and sustainable politics. The semester is divided into five issue blocks, each containing roughly one class on debates popular in the developed world and one case on practices in the developing world.
Students are expected to find their topics and inspirations, which start from self-designing a * City Wanderer© challenge activity and experiencing justice, equality, humanity, and human rights, or more practically speaking, one of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in their own fashion and perspective. Each student should do a City Wanderer oral exhibition and personal report after Midterm week (TBA). After week 12, students will form case study groups based on their preferences. The ultimate goal of these exercises is to deliberate, formulate, and construct a different kind of academic report about a developing country’s human security conditions. This human security * guidebook report should follow regular academic requirements, but include personal narratives and inspirational stories illustrating problems and possible solutions to modern human security issues.
