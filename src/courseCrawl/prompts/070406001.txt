##  課程簡介Course Description
Course Description:
In this EMI (English as a medium of instruction) course, we will focus on six themes: 1) networking; 2) business briefing; 3) entrepreneurship; 4) job hunting preparation; 5) business operation and trends; 6) and essential business English. All the six themes are distributed among three modules. 
In the first module, we will discuss how to socialize and network through face-to-face interaction, telephone, and email. In the second module, we concentrate on personal branding in the job market, in which we introduce essential job search documents, job interview skills, and trends in job market. You will have an opportunity to face interviewers from a wide range of fields in mock interviews. In module three, we then explore essential business briefing skills and business proposals; we also decipher the process of starting a business and common challenges faced by entrepreneurs. To apply what you will have learned, you will build a startup in the final project to pitch your business concept to potential investors.
Throughout the course, we will also discuss essential business English in a miscellaneous collection of materials, including news articles, case studies, podcasts, business reports, and book chapters. You will need to summarize, reflect on, and supplement information for a business-related topic in a mini oral presentation to enhance your understanding of business English.
