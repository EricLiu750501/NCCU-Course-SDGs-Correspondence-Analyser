##  課程簡介Course Description
(暫定)
This course targets students who are interested in processing dataset automatically with programming language. The goal is to let students know how to write scripts with released packages to help further analyze data linguistically with basic knowledge in data processing with basic statistics and models. In this course, we'll handle text data with R (which is one of the prevalent programming languages nowadays). Research articles related to current linguistic issues and application approaches are assigned, and we will have a deeper discussion of these articles during the class. At the end of this course, students will need to do a final presentation and submit a final term paper.
