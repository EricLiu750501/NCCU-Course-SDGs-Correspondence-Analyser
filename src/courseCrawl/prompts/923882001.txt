##  課程簡介Course Description
Part I:
Meeting fundamental human needs while preserving the life support systems of planet Earth will require a world-wide acceleration of today s halting progress in a transition toward sustainability. Understanding Sustainable Cities: Concepts, Cases, and Solutions presents a plethora of subject matters in urban sustainability. Understanding Sustainable Cities: Concepts, Cases, and Solutions provides both instructors and students with in-depth knowledge about crosscutting issues, concepts, and solutions inherent in modern sustainability thinking. Understanding Sustainable Cities: Concepts, Cases, and Solutions: Illustrates how cities can and have applied concepts such as Ecological Footprint, modeling urban sustainability, sustainability indicators, urban adaptation, and climate action planning into their programs, policies, and urban planning and design. Is interdisciplinary and broad-based, reflective of sustainability science itself not directed at any specific technical field or audience. Discusses values and ethics (philosophy), perceptions and behavior (social sciences), green infrastructure (urban ecology and green networks), restoration of cities and place-making (urban planning), green design (urban design and architecture), urban policies and programs (public policy and public administration), and learning from the earliest cities (anthropology and archaeology). Can be used as a supplement in other environmental, sustainability, geology, anthropology, and social sciences classes in which the professor wishes to cover selected issues in sustainable cities or sustainability. 
Part II:
How cities can build on the "sharing economy" and smart technology to deliver a "sharing paradigm" that supports justice, solidarity, and sustainability.
The future of humanity is urban, and the nature of urban space enables, and necessitates, sharing -- of resources, goods and services, experiences. Yet traditional forms of sharing have been undermined in modern cities by social fragmentation and commercialization of the public realm. In Sharing Cities, Duncan McLaren and Julian Agyeman argue that the intersection of cities' highly networked physical space with new digital technologies and new mediated forms of sharing offers cities the opportunity to connect smart technology to justice, solidarity, and sustainability. McLaren and Agyeman explore the opportunities and risks for sustainability, solidarity, and justice in the changing nature of sharing.
McLaren and Agyeman propose a new "sharing paradigm," which goes beyond the faddish "sharing economy" -- seen in such ventures as Uber and TaskRabbit -- to envision models of sharing that are not always commercial but also communal, encouraging trust and collaboration. Detailed case studies of San Francisco, Seoul, Copenhagen, Medellín, Amsterdam, and Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) contextualize the authors' discussions of collaborative consumption and production; the shared public realm, both physical and virtual; the design of sharing to enhance equity and justice; and the prospects for scaling up the sharing paradigm though city governance. They show how sharing could shift values and norms, enable civic engagement and political activism, and rebuild a shared urban commons. Their case for sharing and solidarity offers a powerful alternative for urban futures to conventional "race-to-the-bottom" narratives of competition, enclosure, and division.
