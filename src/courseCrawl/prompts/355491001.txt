You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course focuses on marketing research and its implications for marketing-related topics. More specifically, this independent study will examine the extent to which marketing strategies influence consumer preferences, motivations, and attitudes, which may, in turn, affect consumer decision-making and behavior. In the research process, several potential moderators, such as psychological traits, will also be explored. This doctoral seminar is an ongoing process of reading, discussing, and writing. Students will acquire skill sets that will lead them to become self-motivated and competent researchers who can conduct academic research studies independently after this class.
