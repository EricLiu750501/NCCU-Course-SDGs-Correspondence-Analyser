##  課程簡介Course Description
Notes:
  * Essays : Students write 1 essay (1000 words), due at the mid-term. This essay is written in a style of policy commentary. For this essay, students choose for themselves at least 2 theories from the 16-week course, and a case study. The best essays will be chosen for publication submission at prominent policy platforms of Southeast Asia politics, such as ISEAS’ Fulcrum in Singapore or East Asia Forum in Australia, after sufficient editing.
  * Final paper : Students write 1 individual final paper of 4,000-5,000 words due at the end of the course. Students choose the topic these final papers themselves.
  * Presentations : Students present twice: 1 on the weekly topic of their choice, 1 on the framework of their final papers.
  * The course includes stimulating activities such as debates, games, simulations, and discussing a film. Two alternatives: (1) Title: GIE (2005), an award-winning film, based on the story of Soe Hok Gie (1942-1969), a young Chinese-Indonesian student activist who opposed the dictatorial regimes of presidents Soekarno and Soeharto, directed by Riri Riza; (2) Title: THE LADY (2011), about Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar, directed by Luc Benson.
  * The course is also planned to includean innovative learning method called “Learning Together”: in one of the weeks, our students will learn together with students from NTNU’s Department of East Asia Studies under Prof. Dr. Chang Pi-Chun (張碧君), they are enrolled in a similar course東南亞社會發展歷程 (or another relevant Southeast Asia’s course). This will be done either by us visiting NTNU or receiving NTNU’s students in our classroom.
The course “Hybrid Regimes: Democratic Challenges in Southeast Asia” is designed as a standalone course or as a follow-up course for students who have completed the introductory course “Politics in Southeast Asia: Change and Continuity”. The course delves deeper into the socio-political development in various authoritarian and hybrid regimes in Asia, thereby allowing students to survey, compare and analyze the different, yet persistent, challenges of democracy that these nations are facing. While this course focuses on Southeast Asia, many of these countries’ politics are influenced by their relations to East Asian countries such as China, Taiwan and Japan. Cambodia’s failure to democratize, for many scholars, was partly due to its close relations to China. With this logic, democratization in Southeast Asia can be helped when they have good relations with democratized countries such as Taiwan and Japan. The course also discusses the impact of Taiwan’s foreign policy initiative, the NEW SOUTHBOUND POLICY under which Taiwan’s Southeast Asia’s policies are fostered, as Taiwan seeks to promote closer relations to countries to the south of it.
In the aftermath of the Cold War, a wave of democratization took the world by a storm. The collapse of the Soviet Union shook the foundation of authoritarian regimes in different parts of Asia, as it did in Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. This post-Cold War wave toppled many one-party systems as well as authoritarian regimes and replaced them with new governments seeking to embark upon liberal reforms and democracy. However, transitioning into substantial democracies was not a simple task, and as the euphoria dissipated, many nations soon found out that regime transitions were at times not synonymous with democratic consolidation.
While pure authoritarian regimes are less common in Asia, many nations are in fact “hybrid regimes” or “electoral autocracies” stuck between authoritarianism and democracy. One of the main characteristics is the existence of multi-party elections, yet these are manipulated by government elites, thereby robbing the opposition of the chance of winning. In these nations, the thin veneer of quasi-democratic institutions and multi-party elections became a façade for abuses of power, manipulation and corruption. In Thailand, in the aftermath of the 2019 election the military-backed government dissolved an opposition party and arrested anti-government activists, sparking students’ protest demanding political reforms and a new constitution which would guarantee free and fair election and improve civil liberties. In 2023, the opposition Move Forward Party, won the election and brought a new hope for Thailand’s democracy, yet in the end could not form government as it was impeded by political forces supporting the military. In the Philippines, voters frustrated with crime and elite-based status quo had voted overwhelmingly for the populist Rodrigo Duterte, who employed extra-judicial killings in his “war on drugs”. In 2022, the majority of voters voted for the son and namesake of the former dictator, Ferdinand Marcos, Jr.
Some of the questions the course seeks to answer are: What is democracy good for? Why do some states democratize while others continue to exhibit authoritarianism? How do highly corrupt political regimes survive for decades? How do populist leaders gain and maintain power in Asia? What is the legacy of political violence in newly democratic states? What is the legacy of military-rule in the region? How do global human rights values and “Asian values” play a role in the nations’ politics? The beginning of the course introduces core concepts, regime typologies and indicators for assessing democratization. It subsequently discusses in-depth the development in Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Myanmar, Vietnam and Cambodia.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This interdisciplinary course explores various challenges to democracy in Asia in the post-Cold War period by using case studies. The course takes into account the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as well as the growing important of Artificial Intelligence in the politics of Southeast Asia. The course is divided into two parts: theoretical foundation and country studies. The course introduces various analytical concepts, tools and methodologies which will help the students to analyze possible ways of strengthening democratic traditions in the East and Southeast Asian regions. This approach provides students with a deeper understanding of each nation’s individual roadblocks for democratic governance, as well as the challenges faced in terms of structure and institutions. Upon completing the course, students will be able to: firstly, understand the differences between various regime types and able to identify the typologies across the East and Southeast Asian regions; secondly, analyze the democratization trajectory of various nations and understand the trend of democratic roll-backs in several case study nations, such as Myanmar, Indonesia, and to some extent, Malaysia; thirdly, identify each country’s specific impediments to further democratization; lastly, understand the role of each country’s individual trajectories of nationalism and modernization on their democracy.
