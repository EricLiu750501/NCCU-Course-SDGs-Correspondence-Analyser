You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course introduces students to the core concepts and methods of statistics, with a focus on learning how to use data effectively in the face of uncertainty. Key topics include data visualization, descriptive statistics, probability, statistical inference, and linear regression. Emphasis will be placed on building intuition and practical understanding rather than mathematical rigor.  
Students will develop the skills to make sense of data, draw meaningful conclusions, and communicate results with clarity and confidence. The tools and thinking developed in this course are valuable for making informed decisions and conducting research across a wide range of disciplines. They also form the foundation of many modern applications, including machine learning and artificial intelligence.
