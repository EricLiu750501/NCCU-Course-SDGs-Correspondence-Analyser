##  課程簡介Course Description
本課程將對斯拉夫語言與文化相關主題作一概論性的入門介紹。由於斯拉夫民族分布幅員廣闊，在普遍性的斯拉夫文化框架下，各族群仍具有其個別性與特殊性。因此，本課程將聚焦四大主題：歷史與語言、傳統節慶、傳說童話、人文生活，以東斯拉夫俄羅斯、西斯拉夫捷克與波蘭以及南斯拉夫斯洛維尼亞三大地區進行論述介紹，俾使同學對斯拉夫世界有進一步且較全面性的認識，以建立斯拉夫相關研究的基礎。(本課程將以中英文並行)
This course offers an introduction of Slavic language and culture. Given the vast geographical spread of Slavic ethnic groups, each group retains its distinct identity within the broader Slavic cultural framework. As such, the course will focus on three key themes: history and language, traditional festivals, legends/fairy tales and humanistic life. It will explore the three main regions: East Slav - Russia, West Slav - Czechia and Poland, and South Slav - Slovenia, providing students with a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the Slavic world. This will serve as a foundation for future research in Slavic studies. (The course will be taught in both Chinese and English.
