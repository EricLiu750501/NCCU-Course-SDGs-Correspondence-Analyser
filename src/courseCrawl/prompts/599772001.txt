##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
In this class, learners will practice writing as a process of invention and revision that anyone can master with effort. The course is taught with a particular emphasis on helping non-native-speaking students improve their general English writing skills and language use/sentence structure within the context of creative writing. As with academic writing, students will learn the importance of structure for each writing piece, providing the framework for creative expression. The course is divided into two main sections: creative non-fiction and short-story fiction with additional instruction and practice in screenwriting and poetry. In creative non-fiction, students will learn how to compose travel writing, features/human interest articles, and memoir/personal experience compositions. In fiction, students will learn how to compose a short story, which includes character-creation, world-building, plotting, genre, voice, and dialogue. In addition to non-fiction and fiction skills, students will learn a variety of other creative writing methods, such as composing scenes for film and theater, writing poetry such as haiku and free-verse, and creative journaling. By the end of the course, students will become more confident in their English writing skills and be able to transfer this confidence into any form of writing, whether non-academic or academic.
