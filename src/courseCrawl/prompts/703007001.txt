You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This is a fundamental mathematical course for computer science students. It is intended to introduce to the students basic discrete mathematical tools and skills that are needed in the study of computer science. These skills/tools include
1. mathematical reasoning: for the student be able to read comprehend and construct mathematical arguments  
2. combinatorial analysis and discrete structures: knowledge of which is essential in problem solving/modeling and  
3. algorithmic thinking: that would be helpful in the specification verification and analysis of computer algorithms/programs. Topics introduced in the course include logic induction counting recurrence relations relations graphs and trees.
