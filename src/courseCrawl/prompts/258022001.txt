##  課程簡介Course Description
Course Introduction: Macroeconomics from the Bottom Up — Agent-Based Modeling in the Age of Big Data and AI
1. Why Agent-Based Modeling in Macroeconomics?
In today’s interconnected and data-rich world, understanding the macroeconomy requires more than aggregate equations and representative agents. Agent-based modeling (ABM) offers a complementary, bottom-up perspective, treating the economy as a complex, evolving system of heterogeneous, interacting agents—each endowed with rules, learning capabilities, and adaptive behaviors. In this sense, ABM is not only a method for studying the economy; it is itself a form of artificial intelligence in action—a laboratory where autonomous agents sense, decide, learn, and adapt within dynamic environments. By making AI an inherent part of the model rather than a detached analytical tool, ABM allows us to explore how intelligence—human or artificial—shapes macroeconomic outcomes. This approach equips students with computational tools and conceptual insights to navigate the complexity, uncertainty, and adaptive nature of real-world economies, preparing them for a future in which AI and macroeconomics are increasingly inseparable.
2. Macroeconomics in the Context of the Science of Complexity
It is in this spirit that I invite you to join me on a journey I have personally taken—into the world of complexity science, and with it, a new way of rethinking macroeconomic phenomena from the bottom up. In the late 20th century, a fresh paradigm took root in the study of complex systems: agent-based modeling. This method constructs macro patterns from the ground up, through the interactions of diverse, autonomous agents. Over the course of fourteen lectures, we will examine ABM not only as a powerful tool for economic and financial simulation, but also as a vessel for deeply interdisciplinary ideas, drawing inspiration from physics, biology, sociology, and computer science. These concepts will be set against the backdrop of the history of economic thought and the evolution of the modern economy (Week One).
3. EBM versus ABM: From Equationization to Agentization
Building on this foundation, the second half of the course (Weeks Eleven–Sixteen) will focus on agentization—the process of transforming traditional Equation-Based Models (EBMs) into Agent-Based Models (ABMs). As discussed in my recent work (Chen, 2025), EBMs, rooted in the Newtonian tradition of equation-based mathematics, portray economies through aggregated, often centralized, relationships. ABMs, by contrast, replace these aggregates with populations of heterogeneous, interacting agents, allowing micro-level diversity, adaptation, and social interaction to drive emergent macro patterns. While ABMs can be inspired by EBM prototypes—such as asset pricing models (Weeks Fifteen–Sixteen), overlapping generations models (Week Fourteen), or epidemic equations (Week Eleven)—they are not merely numerical approximations of those equations. Instead, they open an independent window into dynamics that EBMs cannot capture: path dependence, out-of-equilibrium processes, network effects, and behavioral diversity. In the current AI era, this shift is more than methodological; it represents a change in the very language of modeling—from solving fixed equations to simulating evolving intelligences. By “agentizing” macroeconomic models, we integrate the logic of artificial intelligence directly into our economic representations, making the study of macroeconomics more attuned to a world where economies themselves are increasingly shaped by adaptive, algorithmic agents.
4. ABM as a Tool for Policy and Market Design
From a practical standpoint, one of the most distinctive strengths of ABM lies in its application to policy and mechanism (market) design—particularly in environments where data are scarce and uncertainty is high, including the realm of unknown unknowns. ABM allows us to experiment with institutional rules, incentive structures, and policy interventions in silico, observing how different designs play out in complex, adaptive systems before they are implemented in reality. We will return to this theme in Week Twelve, where a concrete case study will illustrate how ABM can serve as a decision-making compass when conventional analytical tools falter.
5. Two Canonical Forms of ABM
You will also be introduced to two canonical forms of ABM:Cellular Automata (CA) – Models where the focus is on simulating local interactions on a grid or network, often producing striking macro patterns from simple rules. Evolutionary Computation (EC) – Models that embed variation, selection, and adaptation, often applied to optimization and evolving systems. Historically, the ABM literature began with CA-ABM, but came into full bloom with EC-ABM. In Week Eight, we will trace this evolution and formally introduce social networks as a bridge between micro-level rules and macro-level patterns. These two kinds of ABM differ in their original scientific ambitions: CA-ABM arose from the quest to simulate the very essence of life—pioneered by John von Neumann (1903–1957) in his work on self-reproducing automata (von Neumann, 1966). We will study this in Weeks Two and Three. EC-ABM grew from the ambition to simulate evolution—not just biological evolution, but adaptation across the entire universe. This allows us to view economies as evolving systems, a topic we will explore in Weeks Eleven and Twelve.
6. Evolution, Co-Evolution, and Multi-Level Dynamics
While CA-ABM can simulate evolution, it tends to do so at a single, macro level. EC-ABM, by contrast, can model co-evolution across multiple levels—a hallmark of complex adaptive systems. This multi-level perspective is central to Neo-Darwinism and has influenced both complexity theory and evolutionary economics (Simon, 1962; op Akkerhuis, 2016; Foster & Metcalfe, 2001). Modeling such intertwined processes would be daunting, if not impossible, without ABM.
7. ABM and the Economics of Social Epidemics
Together, CA-ABM and EC-ABM provide foundational lenses for interpreting macroeconomic dynamics as social epidemics—the spread of ideas, behaviors, and expectations through populations. This framing, popularized by Robert Shiller in Narrative Economics (2019), will be introduced in Weeks Seven and Nine, and revisited repeatedly thereafter to link micro-level agent interactions with macro-level shifts in beliefs and markets.
8. Rules as the True Building Blocks
Beneath the agents themselves lie the rules—codes, genes, neurons, and programs—that drive behavior. Rules can be: Ascribed – fixed from the start; Acquired – learned and adapted through experience. The latter connects directly to bounded rationality, but ABM broadens the scope beyond traditional economics by drawing on biology, psychology, computer science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. This convergence—covered in Weeks Seven, Ten, Twelve, Thirteen and beyond—allows us to model agents who are not only reactive, but adaptive, innovative, and capable of altering the very rules by which they operate.
9. ABM as a Foundation for Big Data and AI-Era Macroeconomics
In one station of the journey, we will turn to the interplay between big data and agent-based modeling (Week Four), drawing on the perspective of Chen and Venkatachalam (2017). Their work frames ABM not merely as a beneficiary of big data, but as its methodological foundation—a way to structure, interpret, and simulate the vast, high-dimensional, and often unstructured information that modern economies generate. In macroeconomics, this connection is especially powerful: big data offers unprecedented real-time signals about consumption, production, employment, and sentiment, yet without a coherent framework, such signals can be overwhelming or even misleading. ABM provides that framework by embedding data into dynamic, micro-founded simulations, allowing us to test how observed patterns might evolve under alternative policies or shocks. This approach is particularly valuable in the AI era, when machine learning algorithms can extract patterns from massive datasets but often lack an explicit causal or structural economic interpretation. ABM bridges that gap: it can integrate AI’s predictive strengths with an explicit, behavior-based model of the economy, enabling us to run what-if scenarios, explore counterfactuals, and design policies with an understanding of underlying mechanisms—not just correlations. In this way, learning macroeconomics through ABM prepares students to work fluently at the intersection of data-rich AI analytics and structural economic reasoning, a skill set increasingly essential for economists in research, policy, and industry.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Course Objectives
This course invites students to see macroeconomics from the bottom up—through the lens of complexity science, agent-based modeling (ABM), and the new realities of the AI era. ABM will be presented not merely as a simulation technique, but as a modeling language in which the economy is represented as a population of adaptive, heterogeneous, and interacting agents. In contrast to traditional Equation-Based Models (EBMs), ABM allows for emergent macro patterns shaped by micro-level diversity, network structures, and dynamic adaptation. By the end of the course, students will understand how ABM can serve as both an analytical tool and a conceptual bridge between economics, artificial intelligence, and the broader sciences of complexity.
Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Explain the fundamental concepts, historical roots, and interdisciplinary scope of ABM within complexity science.
2. 3Develop a decentralized mindset—in contrast to the traditional centralized approach—enabling them to think and model macro phenomena from the bottom up, as exemplified in agent-based analyses of markets.
3. Distinguish clearly between the logic and limitations of EBMs and the flexibility of ABMs, and recognize their complementary rather than competitive nature.
4. Creatively integrate ABM and EBM within unified research frameworks to address macroeconomic issues, drawing on examples from asset pricing, overlapping generations, and epidemic models.
5. Use two canonical forms of ABM—cellular automata and evolutionary computation—to simulate social interactions, evolutionary processes, and macroeconomic dynamics.
6. Apply ABM to represent adaptive, learning, and algorithmic agents, linking economic modeling to the core principles of AI, including machine learning, evolutionary search, and distributed intelligence.
7. Investigate how ABM enables the study of out-of-equilibrium processes, path dependence, and network effects that are difficult or impossible to capture with EBMs.
8. Evaluate the role of ABM in policy simulation and mechanism design, particularly in contexts with limited data, high uncertainty, or the need to anticipate adaptive agent responses.
9. Integrate skills from econometrics, big data analytics, and experimental economics (laboratory with human subjects) into ABM–EBM hybrid approaches for richer macroeconomic insights.
10. Communicate ABM design, results, and policy implications effectively, demonstrating both technical proficiency and critical, interdisciplinary thinking.
