##  課程簡介Course Description
This one-year course teaches how the decisions of private agents determine and affect aggregate economic variables, such as inflation, unemployment, international trade, short-run fluctuations, and long-run economic growth. We will present contemporary theories to explain macroeconomic phenomena. We will also study how government fiscal and monetary policies can be used to stabilize the price level, reach full employment, and promote economic growth. This class will also discuss many cases related to macro policies in the real world to strengthen students' understanding of macroeconomics.
