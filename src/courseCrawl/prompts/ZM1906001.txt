You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course is designed to give students an introduction to cross-cultural research and the theories that govern global communication practices. They will have the opportunity to explore their own cultural backgrounds and how that impacts the way they work and communicate with others internationally; they will have the same opportunity to put themselves in others’ shoes to see the world from new perspectives, enabling them to develop sensitive business and marketing strategies, or develop sensitive journalistic stories that will reach their target audience more effectively. The final project will also give them the chance to practice their media skills on a topic related to culture and understanding cultural perspectives on varying issues.
