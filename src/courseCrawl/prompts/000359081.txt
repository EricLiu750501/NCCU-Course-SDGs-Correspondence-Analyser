You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course aims to provide the students with the essential and fundamental concepts of elementary statistics. The topics include descriptive statistics, probability, sampling, design of experiments, and statistical inferences. At the end of this course, the students should be able to define the real problem, use graphical and numerical summaries, apply standard statistical inference procedures, and conclude statistical analysis. In addition to textbook materials, the students must use the laptop or computer lab for some class activities.
教室座位有限，除非有特殊原因（例如重修很多次），其他的第一堂上課會抽籤，請勿在開學前來信詢問加簽事宜。謝謝。
上課時，統計專有名詞皆以英文表達，因此會有所謂的晶晶體，不喜勿選。
TA課沒有強制上課。
