You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
The course will enable students to develop an understanding of survey research methods and quantitative methods for analyzing international large-scale assessment (ILSA) data. Moreover, the goals of this course are to provide students with the skill sets needed to pose researchable educational questions, locate existing large-scale datasets to answer the questions, understand the data documentation, analyze the existing data appropriately, and communicate the findings in a manner consistent with the standards of the education research community. This course will use the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) as a demonstration. TIMSS provides rich information about the 4th and 8th graders’ mathematics and science achievement achievement and contextual factors, while PISA assesses science, mathematics, and reading literacy with a focus on the particular year.

- understand what ILSAs represent and their trends  
- comprehend how ILSAs are developed, how are being used, and their limitations is important for understanding educational evaluation and the possibilities and restrictions for educational policy  
- identify suitable statistical methods for given research questions.  
- utilize SPSS and IDB Analyzer for statistical computations.  
- demonstrate sufficient statistical knowledge to conduct educational research based on individual research interests.
##  每周課程進度與作業要求 Course Schedule & Requirements
The teaching and learning processes are listed as follows.  
- reading required course materials  
- listening to the contents delivered by the instructor  
- practicing how to get statistical outputs by using SPSS  
- finishing assignments independently  
- delivering presentations to enhance communication skills and knowledge synthesis  
- listening to the contents delivered by the instructor and assimilating insights from peer presentations
Course content
- Introduction to ILSA data  
- Introduction to survey design of ILSAs (e.g., sampling weight, sampling errors)  
- Introduction to measurement issues (e.g., plausible values) of ILSAs  
- Basic statistics (e.g., descriptive statistics, multiple regression)  
- The SPSS and IDB Analyzer environment and application  
- The use of ILSAs data to inform educational policy
Requirements
It is strongly recommended that students have basic knowledge about statistics and students should also have access to the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) during the course.
Note. If students are interested in Mplus, the instructor will also provide extra materials to these students with advanced knowledge in the field.
