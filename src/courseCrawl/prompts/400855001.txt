##  課程簡介Course Description
What is Women’s Cinema? In _Women’s Cinema: The Contested Screen_ , Alison Butler argues that “’Women’s cinema’ is a complex critical, theoretical and institutional construct, brought into existence by audiences, film-makers, journalists, curators, an academics and maintained only by their continuing interest: a hybrid concept, arising from a number of overlapping practices and discourses…” (Alison Butler, 2003, 2) 
The course tackles such complex, hybrid, constructed term by not only understanding it as “works made by women” or “films designed for the female audience,” but by learning about the history and social context in which women have engagd with cinema and new media, both as creators and consumers, and consider the complex interplay between production, consumption, and representation in relation to women and film/media texts.
To do so, the course examines women’s roles, rerpesentations, and experiences from early cinema to comtemporary digital culture. Students are introduced to a diverse set of methodologies and theoretical frameworks which will allow them to explore works from films, television, aniem, video games, and other media forms from various cultures; from the perspectives of film history, auteur, spectatorhsip, genre, feminist criticism, industry, circulation, globalization, and (trans)nationalism. By combining these interdisciplinary approaches, the course introduces a feminist intevention to the existing paradigms and provides studenst with a thorough grasp of women’s cinema and media culture from its historical origins to its current manifestations.
Final projects may take the form of traditional research papers, creative media work, or essay films, encouraging students to engage with course materials through critical and/or creative expression.
