##  課程簡介Course Description
In today's digital era, where information technology is ever-present and artificial intelligence is advancing rapidly, it is crucial for individuals to possess tech-savviness and stay updated with the latest IT trends. The English for Information Technology course is specifically tailored to introduce cutting-edge topics in information technology that directly align with the needs of the Millennials. 
This one-semester 3-credit-hour course is designed for high-intermediate/advanced students of English as a foreign language. This is not a course that aims to teach students information technology knowledge. Rather, it is designed to allow students to transform their English language knowledge into the communication skills necessary for careers in the IT field or any profession. In addition, students are encouraged to think about and consider ethical issues and related topics in information technology. Students will also learn how to discover and discuss new and trending information technologies. A considerable emphasis will be put on training students to create an academic research poster on a topic on issues related to information technology.
