You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

##  課程簡介Course Description
Data-driven computing increasingly depends on high-performance, energy-efficient, reliable, durable, and scalable memory and storage systems. To achieve the diversified design objectives, a number of key technologies have been proposed for memory and storage systems in different application scenarios. In this course, we provide a comprehensive overview of the architecture and key technologies of modern memory/storage systems for graduate students. Specifically, we will discuss the following memory/storage media: (i) magnetic storage media (e.g., CMR, SMR, IMR, and HAMR hard disks), (ii) NAND flash memory, (iii) persistent memories (PMs), such as phase-change memory (PCM), spin-torque transfer RAM (STT-RAM), resistive RAM (ReRAM), domain wall racetrack memory (DW-RM), and skyrmion racetrack memory (SK RM). From the system view, the caching/buffering designs, data placement and space allocation policies, advanced data structures, data encoding and encryption algorithms, data deduplication algorithms, and hardware software codesign issues will be covered. After taking this course, students will be familiar with the foundational design/working principles, key technologies, and future research/development directions of modern memory/storage systems.
