##  課程簡介Course Description
Cartography is the technique, science, and art of transforming data into maps. These maps help us see and understand complex spatial patterns and relationships in a visual way.
Maps are everywhere --- they are part of our daily lives, often used without us even noticing. While traditional paper maps are still important, they have largely been replaced or supplemented by digital maps. However, the core idea of turning data into useful visual information remains the same. Thanks to the digital revolution, cartography has undergone major changes and successfully adapted to modern tools and technologies.
This course introduces students to Digital Cartography by focusing on how maps are made --- from choosing and organizing data, to filtering and interpreting it, to designing clear, effective maps. Students will explore these steps while creating their own maps using powerful digital tools.
Because of its ability to store, manage, analyze and visualize spatial data, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) plays a central role in this process. Throughout the course, students will use GIS to support their cartographic work and bring their map ideas to life.
In addition to traditional cartographic concepts, the course introduces students to modern technologies, including Machine Learning (ML) , that are beginning to influence how maps are made, interpreted, and automated. Students will gain foundational insights into how ML techniques can be used to classify spatial data, detect patterns, or assist in map generalization and feature extraction, helping them understand the growing role of intelligent systems in the future of cartography.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the theoretical and practical foundations of cartography and map design in the digital age. It emphasizes how spatial data is transformed into effective visual communication through maps. Students will gain hands-on experience using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and be introduced to state-of-the-art technologies, such as Machine Learning tools for mapping, hat are reshaping the way spatial data is analyzed and visualized.
Map creation will focus on a variety of use cases, including physical maps, charts and plans, complex thematic maps incorporating relevant topics such as hazard mapping and Sustainable Development Goals (in particular SDG 11 and 15), and topological maps (network maps) 
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
  * Understand and apply core cartographic concepts, including scale, projection, generalization, and symbolization.
  * Identify, evaluate, and select appropriate spatial data for specific mapping purposes.
  * Design effective map concepts that reflect the intended message and audience.
  * Transform raw data into higher-level, interpretable information through filtering, classification, and visual hierarchy.
  * Produce digital maps using standard cartographic techniques and GIS tools that adhere to principles of effective visual communication.
  * Use international cartographic terminology to describe and critique their map products.
  * Gain foundational awareness of how AI and machine learning are used in cartography, e.g., in automating feature recognition, supporting data generalization, or enhancing spatial pattern detection.
  * Critically assess the strengths and limitations of AI-supported mapping workflows.
##  每周課程進度與作業要求 Course Schedule & Requirements
Classes are 3 hours and take place in the GIS lab (270610). Due to the highly practical nature of this course, we will follow a hybrid approach with mixed theory and practice.
This course and all handout/upload material are provided in English, therefore a basic command of the English language will be required. Also, a basic understanding of spatial data and a feeling for spatial information and relationships are of advantage. For the technical aspects of this course, a basic knowledge of trigonometry and trigonometric identities, and a basic understanding of coordinate systems and transformations will be beneficial.
