##  課程簡介Course Description
The collapse of authoritarian rule in Southern Europe, Latin America and East Asia which began in the 1970s, the breakdown of Communist regimes in East Europe and the former Soviet Union which began in 1989, and the recent color revolutions and the Arab Spring which began in the 2000s, have revived interest in the study of democratization. Despite its initial achievements, some setbacks remain. The longstanding debates on the causes and consequences of democratization remain unresolved. The course mainly explores the ongoing process of democratization in the post-communist countries in both theory and practice and investigates sources of democratic backsliding and resilience.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
The course aims to address the following questions to advance understanding of democracy: Does the literature of transition from authoritarian regimes shed light on the developmental trend and pattern of Soviet-type regime transition? Is the liberal democratic order in crisis? What explains the persistence and vulnerability of existing authoritarian regimes? How can democracy be effective and sustainable? 
Students are introduced to contending perspectives on the major issues of post-communist democratization.
