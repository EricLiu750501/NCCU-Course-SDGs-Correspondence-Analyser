The nature of this course is demanding and challenging. It is time-consuming for a college student beyond freshman year to master the subject. To succeed, you need to devote serious efforts both during and outside of classes. If you do not intend to spend time on this subject, it is suggested that you should not take this course. Come to each class meeting prepared. 
The course materials are presented through a mix of class lectures, assigned readings, and problems. You should maximize your understanding of the materials by attending and participating in class lectures and discussions. To be successful, you are expected to do the following: 
  1. read the assigned readings and be prepared before you come to the class. 
  2. arrive on time. 
  3. be actively involved in class by asking questions and participating in discussions. 
  4. review the assigned reading and attempt all homework problems after the class. 
After you have done everything you are expected to do, if you still have difficulty with the materials we discuss in class, my office hours are available for you.
