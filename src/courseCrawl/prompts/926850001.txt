##  課程簡介Course Description
This course aims to provide students with a fundamental understanding of China's economic, social, and political development since 1978. Four main themes are involved. The first is the introduction. We will introduce this course with a discussion on the universality and particularity of the "China Model" from a comparative perspective. The second theme is economic transformation. We will explore China's industrialization and engagement with the world economy after the 1978 reform and opening up by examining the roles of the central government, local governments, the financial system, the fiscal system, state-owned enterprises, private enterprises, and foreign enterprises. The third theme is social changes. We will investigate the impacts that economic transformation brought to society in many aspects, including the urban-rural divide, social stratification, the one-child policy and its impact on demographics, as well as environmental issues. The fourth theme is political development. We will explore the implications of economic development for the prospect of democracy in China, as well as the impact that China's rise might bring to international political development. Moreover, we will show to and discuss with students three selected movies related to the topics in the course, with an aim to improve students' understanding of some critical scenarios in the processes of China's political and economic development.
