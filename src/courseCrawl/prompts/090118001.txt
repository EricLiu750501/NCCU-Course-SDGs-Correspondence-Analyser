Classroom behavior
My philosophy of education is the teacher-student / student-teacher model: teachers are students, and students are teachers. So, all members of the classroom community are responsible for the success of the class: attendance is expected, verbal participation is encouraged, and student-teachers demonstrate respect for one another. 
課堂規則
我的教育理念是 “老師是學生/學生是老師” 的模式。因此，課堂班級的所有成員負責課程的成功. 預計上課，鼓勵口服參與，並老師學生演示對彼此的尊重。
