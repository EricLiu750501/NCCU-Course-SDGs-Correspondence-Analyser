You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
Econometrics is a discipline grounded in advanced economic theories and various quantitative methods. It focuses on empirical tasks of analyzing observational data, such as estimating causal effects, testing economic theories, evaluating and implementing government and business policies, and forecasting key macroeconomic indicators.  
Econometrics has become indispensable for economists conducting serious empirical research. This one-semester course is designed to introduce graduate-level students to well-established econometric tools, particularly regression-based methods for handling cross-sectional data. 
The course will cover the following topics:
Course introduction: modern Econometrics and causal inference
Multiple regression analysis: estimation 
Multiple regression analysis: inference 
Multiple regression analysis: OLS asymptotics
Multiple regression analysis: further issues
Multiple regression analysis with qualitative information
Heteroskedasticity
Instrumental variables estimation and two stage least squares
Limited dependent variable Models and sample selection corrections
Instructional Method: Lecture
Course Requirements:
Students should have a solid understanding of undergraduate-level statistics, calculus, linear algebra, and economics before enrolling in the course. Regular attendance at lectures and completion of assigned exercises are required.
Please note that the course will begin with multiple regression analysis rather than simple regression analysis. Therefore, students who are not familiar with simple regression analysis (or the relevant statistical tools) are encouraged to review these concepts independently to ensure they can keep up with the course material.
