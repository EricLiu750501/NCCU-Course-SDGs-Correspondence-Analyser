##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Aims & Objectives
Accounting, often described as the language of business, enables the communication of financial aspects within a business. This module introduces the financial accounting branch of accounting. Through the financial accounting process, business activities and events are summarized into published financial statements, which are then used by external users such as investors and creditors. These users must understand both the financial accounting process and its outputs to make informed investing or lending decisions. Consequently, students will learn how to prepare simple financial statements, as well as how to read, understand, and use published financial statements for decision-making. Examples will be drawn from the published financial statements of listed companies.
Learning Outcomes
After completing this course, you will be able to:
  * Describe the nature and purpose of accounting for business;
  * Comprehend accounting terminology and basic concepts underlying financial accounting;
  * Recognize that accounting is not a precise science but relies heavily on judgments and estimates;
  * Account for common elements of the financial statements and prepare simple financial statements;
  * Perform basic financial statement analysis and interpret financial reports.
