##  課程簡介Course Description
This course introduces students to the principles and practices of video design and dissemination through an integration of theory and application. The course first engages students with a range of theoretical perspectives—including cognitive psychology, multimedia design principles, communication theories, and storytelling frameworks—to develop a solid conceptual foundation for understanding how videos are perceived, processed, and communicated. Building on these theories, students will then apply their knowledge through hands-on activities using digital video tools, experimenting with design techniques and production strategies. By moving from theory to practice, students will critically examine and refine their own video projects, gaining both analytical insight and practical competence in video design and planning.
