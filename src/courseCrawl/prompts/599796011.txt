##  課程簡介Course Description
_Workplace Communication_ is a one-semester 3-credit-hour course designed for high-intermediate/advanced students of English as a foreign language. This is _not_ a course that aims to teach students business knowledge. Rather, it is designed to allow students to transform their English language knowledge into communicative skills necessary for the workplace in any profession.
Traditionally, “English at the workplace” often means “business English” which involves business terminology and business correspondence. However, as we embrace constant changes at work in the 21st century, particular content knowledge will soon be outdated. What is needed, therefore, is adaptability in cross-cultural contexts,as well as productive language skills for the ever-changing workplace.In this course, students are expected to use the English language to teleconference, to analyze case studies, to conduct individual or group presentations, to write job-hunting documents, and to compose formal emails and case reports. It is hoped that, through the vehicle of English language, as well as the exposure to the finer points of international workplace etiquette, students are able to, not only sharpen their language skills, but also develop a proper mindset and cross-cultural awareness that are essential to one’s success in any job.
