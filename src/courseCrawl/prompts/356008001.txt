##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
The course is also designed to familiarize students with rudimentary statistical methods for research using R. In each class meeting, students will present and discuss research papers and techniques. I will guide students to carefully evaluate research design of assigned readings, and penetrate into research method(s) employed to address research questions. Grounded on a “learning by doing” philosophy, the course is aimed to be a transformational process that helps students intuitively understand, critically question, and even creatively improve existing work.
