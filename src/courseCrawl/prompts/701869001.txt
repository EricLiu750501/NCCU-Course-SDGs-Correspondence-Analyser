You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This is a second course on combinatorics which is an important branch of discrete mathematics. We will review some of the concepts from discrete mathematics (e.g., basic counting and generating function) and considerably deepen them. More precisely, the course will focus on enumerative combinatorics which is concerned with the basic question of "counting". In addition, if time permits, a short introduction into asymptotic combinatorics will be given as well.
