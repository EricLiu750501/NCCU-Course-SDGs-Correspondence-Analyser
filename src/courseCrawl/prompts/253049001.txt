##  課程簡介Course Description
This course introduces concepts, theoretical arguments, and theoretical applications of theories of international relations. The primary focus is the mainstream theories in IR. At the beginning of the course, we will go through basic concepts in the field of IR. In the following weeks, students will study the major debates between different IR theories. In addition to the mainstream theories, we will discuss feminism, foreign policy decision-making, and the English school. These theoretical debates carry our field forward and improve the validity and reliability of IR research. Students are expected to provide critical reviews on class materials. Students are also expected to express their reflections in the class.
