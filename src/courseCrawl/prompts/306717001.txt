You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course introduces foundational skills in program analysis and testing, which are essential for building software systems with greater reliability and security. The course examines primarily two complementary approaches: static analysis, where we analyze source code without execution to uncover potential security vulnerabilities, and dynamic analysis, where we study program behavior during runtime to detect actual security breaches. Students will learn to bridge theory and practice by implementing these analyses using modern tools and frameworks.
Prospective students should have familiarity with Python programming and a basic understanding of discrete mathematics and data structures. _The course includes weekly lab sessions, and students may need a laptop to participate in some of these sessions._

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
We assess the achievement of learning objectives through classroom discussions and exercises, assignments, a midterm exam, and a final project. These objectives include:
  * Technical Skills in Program Analysis: Students will learn to implement various program analysis techniques including dataflow analysis, Hoare logic, symbolic execution, and dynamic analysis. They will also explore how abstract interpretation principles can automate program analysis frameworks.
  * Formal Methods and Evaluation: Students will gain the ability to use abstract interpretation to formally prove the soundness and termination of an analysis. They will also learn to evaluate the scalability of program analyses and compare the precision of different techniques.
  * General Computer Science Skills: The course also focuses on developing transferable skills, such as:
    * Rigorously reasoning about the behavior of code.
    * Formally modeling discrete software systems and proving theorems about these models.
    * Building moderately complex programs using software frameworks.
    * Utilizing open-source analyzing/testing tools effectively.
