You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This class is designed to provide solid training for graduate students to conduct qualitative research and publish the results accordingly. It starts with the introduction of ontology, epistemology, methodology, and eventually research methods for decent qualitative research. It also covers the issues of identifying workable research topics from daily life observations.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Research methods are something that should be learned by doing. It is a craft that can hardly be expressed in words. Nevertheless, comprehension of the logic behind the choices of research designs, data collection tools, and fieldwork dynamics would help the researchers get the tacit knowledge to do things right. This course starts with possible approaches for studying human phenomena and strategic thinking about research designs—from picking up a potential topic to matching it with proper research methods. The course would also provide some technical details on fieldwork. It will further demonstrate how to wrap up the research results for publication.
