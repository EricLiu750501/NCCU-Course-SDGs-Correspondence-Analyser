You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course is the first part of the first-year Master's econometrics sequence. The course covers core topics in modern econometric theory and methods centered on linear regression, including matrix algebra for econometrics and statistics, conditional expectation and projection, the algebra of least squares, least squares regression and normal regression, large sample asymptotics, and asymptotic theory of least squares. Emphasis is placed on building intuition and understand the theoretical foundations to support practical applications. 
Prerequisites include solid undergraduate-level background in linear and matrix algebra, calculus, statistics, and introductory econometrics.
