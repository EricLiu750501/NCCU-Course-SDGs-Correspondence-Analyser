2. Attendance and Participation
  * If you are unable to attend a class, you must notify the professor via email before the class begins. Upon your return, you are required to provide valid documentation to formalize your absence. Alternative methods, such as having a friend inform the professor about your illness, will not be accepted. Leave requests must be supported by legitimate reasons; excuses such as travel or taking a driver’s license test will not be considered valid.
  * Attendance will be monitored. Arriving late to class will result in a one-point deduction from your final grade. Missing an entire class will incur a two-point deduction. Students who accumulate three absences will automatically fail the course.
3. Late Work Policy
  *     * 1 day late (i.e., immediately after the deadline up to 24 hours later): -10%
    * 2 days late (i.e., 24 to 48 hours after the deadline): -25%
    * 3 days late (i.e., 48 to 72 hours after the deadline): -50%
    * > 3 days late: -100% (I will not grade the assignment.)
4. Team Formation
  * Each team must consist of either two master's students or one Ph.D. student.
5. Additional Requirement for Ph.D. Students
  * Ph.D. students are required to independently write weekly reflection papers, facilitate class sessions, and complete the term paper on their own.
