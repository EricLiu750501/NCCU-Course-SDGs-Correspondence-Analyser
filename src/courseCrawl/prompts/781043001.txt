You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course aims to help students understand the interaction process between people and products through lectures and assignments, so they can understand how to design the best interaction experiences with digital media. The word “products” here refers to all objects, digital contents, or services in our environment. 
The course consists of these units:
  1. The nature of interaction  
In all things interactive, interaction must go through an “interface” defined by several elements. Interacting through interfaces is one of the fundamentals of how the world works. The course will explain from an analytical point of view what various interface concepts have in common, how they form the basis of human-computer interaction, and how the concepts of human-computer interaction (HCI) are applied to various phenomena.  
  2. The psychological basis of HCI  
“Human” is the core of HCI, but what does that even mean? What kind of constraints need to be considered? What principles do people follow when processing information in interfaces and interactive processes? Starting from the visual system, this unit introduces knowledge regarding perception, memory, cognition, and laws of Human Factors engineering. What does “intuitive” really mean?   
  3. The relationship between HCI and communication, including classical communication theory and principles of human-human dialogues, and how these principles become the foundation of HCI; how to apply these principles to understand interaction results or errors.  
  4. The context of HCI and design, including basic design research methods, data presentation, and how to deepen the understanding of both the user (human) and the function (machine) from the data.  
  5. Methods and tools of designing HCI, task design axes, and goals. This unit will also discuss design elements of human-computer interfaces, such as graphical interface elements and rules, information visualization, perceptual design, and information architecture.  
  6. Prototyping and evaluation of HCI design. A prototype is a means of verification and optimization, and effective prototyping must be accompanied by effective evaluation. This chapter introduces different prototyping techniques and different evaluation methods.  
  7. New HCI technologies, including the basic technologies of Metaverse such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their impacts on future HCI development.  
Note: This course will be taught in English.

##  每周課程進度與作業要求 Course Schedule & Requirements
The following schedule explains the basic structure of the course. The actual content of each week may be adjusted each semester. Also, this cousre requires a total of 64.5 hours of workload outside the classroom, which includes group discussion, homework, and presentation online, thus fulfilling the Ministry of Education's stupid mandate to "fit a 18-week course into 16 weeks."
