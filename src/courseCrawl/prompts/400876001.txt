You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This is a mandatory course for IMICS students and an optional course for GCIT students. The goal of the course is to both introduce students to research methodologies within the broad field of Communication Science and give them hands-on experience analyzing data obtained from these varied study types. Students will learn about qualitative (i.e., interviews, focus groups, content analyses) and quantitative (e.g., surveys, experiments) research methodologies, their strengths and weaknesses, and how to consider both methodology and theory when engaging in study design.
