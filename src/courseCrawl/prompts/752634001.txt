You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
Category learning is fundamental to human cognition, with which miscellaneous objects can be grouped or separated as different categories, which are regarded as the units representing the world we learn. Thus, understanding how categories are formed can help us understand how our cognitive system may function, hence benefiting unveiling the secret of human intelligence and designing human-like machines. Since 1960's, psychologists have proposed a large number of models for accounting for human categorization and category leanring. In this course, the most influential models of category learning will be taught to students, together with the theoretical debates between them. After learning this course, students are expected to know what category learning is referred to, how to conduct behavioral experiments for examining category learning, what the important issues are in category learning, and how to develop a computational model for category learning.
