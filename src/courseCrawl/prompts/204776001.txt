You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course introduces the life course perspective—the study of how people’s lives unfold over time within social, historical, and institutional contexts. We cover core concepts (trajectories, transitions, timing, duration, turning points, linked lives, cohort/period/age), theories of cumulative (dis)advantage, and the roles of family, education, work, health, and policy across life stages. Students will learn how life course scholars ask questions, measure change, and interpret evidence using longitudinal and mixed-methods data. Class activities emphasize reading empirical studies, hands-on exploration of simple longitudinal datasets, and communicating findings to academic and policy audiences. By the end of the course, students will be prepared to critically evaluate life course research and to design a basic, feasible study on a topic of their choice.
