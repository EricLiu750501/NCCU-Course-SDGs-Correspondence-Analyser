##  課程簡介Course Description
This is a compulsory course for graduate students of the Department of International Business who have major in the International Trade Law. It has four different course numbers: (I), (II), (III) and (IV). However, it is not required to take them in a sequential order. Nevertheless, for graduate students enrolled after 2009, it is required to take at least three of them before applying for oral defense of their master thesis.  This course is to develop students’ ability of independent research on the most current issues of international trade law. The topics for research and writing exercises will be determined weekly, based on the most current trade and economic issues selected by the students and approved by the instructor. All research papers are required to have publishable-quality, and after the instructor’s review, to be published on the bi-weekly Trade Law E-Newsletter of the Research Center for International Organization and Trade Law.

The course has its focus on independent research. The intensive research and writing exercises are designed to facilitate students to start their search for thesis topics as early as possible, and on the other hand, improve their research and writing ability. Both ways contribute to the quality of their thesis. Because the students are required to submit a research topic on current issues to the instructor for approval weekly, it also helps students to make a habit of continuously exploring issues of international trade law and build up the capacity to complete research in a timely manner under time pressure. Learning Outcomes
  1. Learning to apply multilateral trade rules to current international trade issues, esp. SPS, TBT, and service trade, etc.
  2. Mastering the interpretation of WTO rules
  3. Analyzing new WTO dispute settlement cases by applying its jurisprudence.
  4. Learning RTAs issues, such as Mega-FTAs
  5. Following emerging economic and trade issues, such as climate change, digital service tax, WTO reform, trade and XX, etc.
