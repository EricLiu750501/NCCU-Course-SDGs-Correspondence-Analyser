##  課程簡介Course Description
Despite the fact that the Pacific Region is largely covered by water, it is a culturally extremely diverse region. From Island South-East, and more than 2300 languages on its islands. In this course, we investigate from an interdisciplinary perspective the languages belonging to the main language groups of the Pacific region: the Australian, Papuan, and Austronesian language families, and various languages that entered the Pacific area in colonial times. We discuss their history, their present distribution and status, their associated cultures, and some of their structural properties. While mainly focusing on indigenous languages, we also spend some time on the linguistic impact of different colonization waves. In a number of case studies, students will present interesting aspects of key languages.
This course is taught in English.
