You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
Course Description:
This class will examine the institution of sovereign rule from the bottom up, taking stock of the emergence of ancient states and attending to three distinct, but shifting registers in which sovereignty emerges in modern formations. One addresses the nation-state as a territorially and ideologically bounded entity, another engages with indigenous understandings of social relationships with the earth, which folds into the third register of Indigenous People’s sovereign claims to territory. To unpack these interconnected strands, we begin by examining ancient sovereigns form from East and Southeast Asia using anthropological and archeological data to complicate the story of civilization. We will attend to god kings and emperors, as well as the modern forms of territorial control that emerged from those ancient states. With this, we will turn the assumption of teleological progress into a question. Is the institution of the sovereign nation part of an evolutionary process of human social life? To address this question, we turn to the cults of soil and water common to indigenous communities across the region. There are elements of these practices that are directly connected to ancient forms of sovereignty. Part of our work will be to identify this connective tissue, as well as what possibilities are severed in the shift to sovereignty. From this perspective, we can follow the trail of sovereignty as it emerges out of the resources it consumes and, in this context, will consider the contested spaces where contemporary Indigenous Peoples make sovereign claims. The purpose of this examination is to consider alternative ways to frame contemporary questions about territory, resources, and the organization of place and society. We will ask more questions than we answer in this class, and participants should come prepared to think together about the creative process of social organization.

_Three-credit course_
To achieve the three-credit course requirement, this course offers at least 54 hours of instruction.
We will meet physically in class for 3-hour sessions weekly (42 hours). Week 8 is a mid-term take-home exam. Week 16 is the final take-home exam. 
Office hour instruction is offered each week (3 hours/wk. adding 48 hours of additional instruction opportunities). 
_Class Participation_
Show up, on time, prepared to discuss the week’s readings. Computers or cell phones are for note taking, translation assistance, or researching course-related things. Do not do other work during class time. Be respectful of others’ opinions, share interesting things related to the discussion, be mindful of others who may be more shy than you. Students are invited to prepare presentations for class related to course material or to their own explorations of sovereignty. Presentations will be considered extra credit toward enhancing the class participation grade. 
_Midterm Exam_
Short answer, open book essay exam. You will be provided 6 questions, you will choose 4 and write no more than 1000 words to answer each question. Your answers should be in the form of an academic argument, not a summary, and will be graded on the demonstrated understanding of the material. 
_Final Paper_
Write 15-20 pages on a topic related to the course materials and your own research project. This will be graded on the extent to which it makes an original argument, attends to course materials, has a sophisticated literature review, and provides convincing evidence in support of the argument. The paper should be in a formal academic style and should be considered a draft essay for a journal publication. 
_Pop Quiz_
At random moments during the course, the professor will announce a pop quiz. Students will be given 15 min at the beginning of class to answer a question related to the week’s readings. Quizzes are scored on a 10-point scale according to the extent to which the question is answered and the student demonstrates having read and understood the assignment.
