##  課程簡介Course Description
This course is designed to provide an opportunity for students to learn international communication and international relations through an inter-disciplinary, integrated approach. The class will be taught in Chinese, but students are encouraged to answer their examination papers in English. This manual serves as a guide for students to prepare for the class and do their own study either during the academic year on the campus or afterwards. The course covers both theory and practice for the two disciplines: international communication and international relations. Philosophy, Politics and Economics(PPE) will be introduced together with the history of diplomacy and journalism. Students will be able to understand that the two areas of studies are so interweaved to become almost just one huge data bank for the human beings. Please refer to the attached manual of teaching. I will explain the basic concepts first and, then, share my views on the questions listed in the manual. A comprehensive suggested reading list is provided. Students are encouraged to use data, digital and AI materials in the couse of their study.
