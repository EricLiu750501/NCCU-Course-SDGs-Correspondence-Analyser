##  課程簡介Course Description
This course introduces students to the theory and practice of financial derivatives, including forwards, futures, options, swaps, and structured products. Emphasis is placed on pricing, valuation, and hedging strategies. Starting this semester, the course will be taught in English and will incorporate Bloomberg-based assignments and projects. These updates reflect valuable feedback from alumni who emphasized the importance of Bloomberg fluency and English communication skills in international finance environments, especially during internships or employment at multinational institutions.
The basic concepts of financial derivatives will not be covered in this course. Students are expected to review and understand the fundamentals on their own.
Additionally, international exchange students who did not study derivatives during their undergraduate years are advised not to take this required course, as it has a heavier workload.
