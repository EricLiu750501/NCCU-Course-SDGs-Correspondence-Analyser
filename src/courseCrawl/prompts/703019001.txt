You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course introduces the fundamental concepts of computer architecture and emphasizes practical implementation. Students will have ample opportunities to apply what they learn through a variety of hands-on examples. By the end of the course, students are expected to identify the basic components of a computer, particularly CPUs and memory systems, and explain how they function from the digital logic level to the operating system level.
