##  課程簡介Course Description
Corporate governance traditionally focuses on the relationships among a company's management, board of directors, shareholder, and even and how these relationships affect a company's operations and performance. But in addition to performance in financial statements, the role of environmental, social and governance (ESG) in corporate governance has also received increasing attention in recent years. As environmental and social issues increase, investors are demanding that companies incorporate ESG principles into their corporate governance policies so that they can make informed decisions about their investment. Investors take a company's ESG performance into consideration when investing, not only to obtain a high monetary return on investment, but also to ensure that the company's operations will not damage the environment or violate human rights, etc., and also enable the company to fulfill its social and sustainable responsibilities. This course will discuss a range of issues related to the role of companies in the environment, society and governance, and the development of related responsibilities and obligations.  
This course requires students to complete a short essay and give a class presentation. The purpose of this class is not only to gain an in-depth understanding of emerging corporate governance issues, but also to increase students' reading ability in foreign literature. In addition, in order to help students be more detailed in citations of their articles, the first few weeks of this class will teach the Bluebook Citation System, so that students can correctly present the citation format in their essays.
