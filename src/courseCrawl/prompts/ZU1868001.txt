##  課程簡介Course Description
本課程旨在培養學生深入理解並實踐永續發展策略。我們將引導對相關商業模式、社會企業、非營利組織運作或政策推動抱有熱情的學員，探索永續發展在商業與非商業領域(例如非營利組織或政策倡議等)多元策略與應用。
課程將區分為兩部分。  
第一部分在於探討各界如何透過系統性變革，共同應對全球性的永續挑戰，包括氣候變遷、平等、貧窮等議題。我們將聚焦於如何整合”環境（Environmental）、社會（Social）與治理（Governance, ESG）”等關鍵要素，以實現聯合國永續發展目標 (SDGs)。
第二部分將討論永續商業模式及策略。本學期將永續商業模式重心放在"循環經濟"及"社會企業"兩個模組。於”循環經濟”模組將邀請實務講者、公司參訪及鼓勵同學參加循環經濟相關論壇。於”社會企業”模組將安排學生到南萬華(大加蚋)的社會企業與非營利組織參訪，了解南萬華的社會議題(包含貧窮、新移民、不平等)。
期末報告將以分組方式，訪談南萬華的社會企業/非營利組織，以了解目前組織的挑戰，進而透過小組討論集思廣益找出優化該組織現有商業模式的方式。期末報告將以分組方式: (1)製作影片呈現該組織處理的社會問題及挑戰，(2)提出優化該組織現有商業模式的建議。 本課程將邀請在地組織參加本班學生設計規劃的沙龍，各組將上台分享優化該組織商業模式給萬華在地組織，並由在地組織當場評分頒獎。
本課程期待將學生培養成為具備國際視野與在地實踐能力的永續發展領域領導者。無論未來學生投身任何產業或部門，都能掌握企業、政府、與非營利組織間的協作機制，共同推動解決氣候變遷、循環經濟、貧窮、多元平等共融(DEI)等全球性環境與社會議題，並進而找出可行的商業模式或政策，為社會創造正向影響力。
This advanced course in "Sustainable Development and Local Revitalization" is designed to give you a deep understanding of sustainability strategies and how to put them into practice. If you're passionate about business models, social enterprises, non-profit operations, or policy advocacyrelated to sustainability, this course will help you explore various approaches in both commercial and non-commercial sectors (like non-profits or policy advocacy).
At its core, the course examines how different groups can work together through systemic changeto tackle global sustainability challenges. This includes pressing issues such as climate change, the circular economy, equality, and poverty. We'll focus on how to integrate key elements of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Our main goal for this course is to prepare you to become a leader in sustainable development, equipped with both a big-picture perspective and practical skills. No matter what industry or field you enter, you'll learn how businesses, governments, and non-profit organizations can collaborate. This collaboration is crucial for addressing global environmental and social issues like climate change, the circular economy, poverty, and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI). Ultimately, you'll be able to identify viable business models, social enterprises or policies that protect natural resources and human rights, creating a positive impact on society.
Course Structure
The course is divided into two main parts:
Part One focuses on how various sectors can collaborate through systemic change to address global sustainability challenges. This includes pressing issues such as climate changes, equality, and poverty. We'll explore case studies that demonstrate how key Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors are successfully leveraged to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Part Two delves into sustainable business models and strategies. This semester, our focus will be on two core modules: Circular Economy and Social Enterprise. The Circular Economy module will feature insights from guest speakers from industry, include company visits, and encourage student participation in relevant forums. For the Social Enterprise module, students will visit social enterprises and non-profit organizations in Nan-Wanhua (Dajiali) to gain firsthand understanding of local social issues, including poverty, new immigrant integration, and inequality.
Final Project and Impact
For the final project, students will work in teams to interview social enterprises and non-profit organizations in Nan-Wanhua. The goal is to help these organizations optimize their existing business models. Teams will create videos showcasing the social problems and challenges these organizations address. We'll then host a "salon" style event where local Wanhua organizations will be invited to attend. Each student group will present their proposed business model optimizations to the local organizations, who will provide on-the-spot evaluations and awards.
