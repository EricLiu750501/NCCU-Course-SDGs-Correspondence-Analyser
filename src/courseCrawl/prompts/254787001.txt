##  課程簡介Course Description
As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, complex health issues—including pandemics, climate-driven health crises, chronic diseases, and digital health innovations—transcend national boundaries, demanding integrated, multidisciplinary, and global solutions. This course is designed to equip future global health policymakers and practitioners with the analytical skills, evaluative insights, and creative strategies essential for effective health governance in a rapidly evolving global landscape.
Throughout the semester, students will critically examine pressing global health governance issues, including infectious diseases, mental health, NCDs, equitable medicine access, digital health data privacy, health system strengthening, primary healthcare strategies, and the role of international health organizations. Each session, led by expert instructors and guest speakers, encourages students to actively analyze complex scenarios, evaluate diverse perspectives, and propose innovative policy solutions.
In the final weeks, students will actively participate in a World Health Organization (WHO) simulation exercise. This highly interactive simulation challenges students to synthesize knowledge and apply their analytical and creative problem-solving skills in realistic, high-stakes public health emergencies. Students will represent various countries and stakeholder roles, collaborating with invited external experts, civil society representatives, and media professionals. Through this experiential learning approach, students will cultivate competencies essential for addressing complex global health governance challenges in real-world contexts.
