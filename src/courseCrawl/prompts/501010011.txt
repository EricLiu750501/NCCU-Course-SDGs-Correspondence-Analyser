##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This is a survey course of Western literature designed to give students a better understanding of the Western cultural tradition and Western literature. This course aims to introduce an overview of the development of literature in Western civilization. This course first introduces Greek mythologies and the epic to explore the cosmology of ancient Greece. After discussing _The Epic of Gilgamesh_ and Homer's  _The Iliad and The Odyssey_ , we move onto the world of Greek philosophy by reading Plato's  _Symposium,_ Aristotle’s _Poetics, and_ Sappho's poetry. 
The second part of this course focuses on Greek theater, Roman Literature and the Bible. We will first read Aeschylus, _Agamemnon,_ Sophocles's  _Oedipus the King,_ Euripides's  _Medea_ , and _Lysistrata_. The course will then discuss Ovid’s _Metamorphoses_ to see how the Romans reshaped Greek mythology. The Old and New Testament will be read in both the first and the second section to form a basis of comparison. Each of these works will be explored closely, analyzed carefully, and discussed with its cultural and historical context. The course will proceed mainly in three forms: lectures, small group discussions, and online forums. Every week, students need to finish reading materials, post responses on the course website’s forum, and watch videos before or after class, if necessary. At the beginning of each class, we will have a 10-minute quiz. Students are also required to do a 15-minute group presentation in class.
Studnets are expected to develop the ability to express oneself, discuss and communicate in correct and fluent English, and to read and comprehend long English texts and to appreciate their cultural contexts. The course will also cultivate students' ability to think independently, make inquiries, hold discussions, and solve problems, and develop their professional and cultural knowledge through extensive reading. Finally, the students are expected to gain the ability to undertake life-long, self-directed learning, and to think creatively and develop a second specialty.
