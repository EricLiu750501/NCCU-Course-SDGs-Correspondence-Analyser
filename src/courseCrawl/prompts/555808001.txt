You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This class provides an introduction to the acoustic properties of speech sounds along with the anatomy and physiology of speech production. In particular, the course examines various aspects of human speech production and perception as well as the nature of the acoustic signal transmitted from speaker to listener.
The acoustic features to be explored include time-domain properties such as waveform amplitude, duration and fundamental frequency (F₀) as well as frequency-domain characteristics such as the frequency spectrum, spectrogram and combined spectrotemporal features.
The course also includes hands-on training in transcribing and identifying sounds using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Students will learn to create and analyze broadband spectrograms using PRAAT (Boersma & Weenink, 2020) and will explore a wide range of articulatory and acoustic patterns found in the world’s languages.
The course consists of two-hour lecture sessions and one-hour laboratory components each week.
