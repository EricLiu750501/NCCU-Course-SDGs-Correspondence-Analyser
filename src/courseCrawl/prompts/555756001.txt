##  課程簡介Course Description
This course addresses how human beings process language in real-time, grounded in the architecture of our mental grammar and cognitive systems. We will discuss various psycholinguistic models of language processing rooted in different theoretical frameworks of linguistics, with an emphasis on the integration of experimental evidence and theoretical analysis. To understand how our language architecture supports online sentence comprehension, we will take an overview of the theoretical accounts, examine the linguistic patterns and empirical findings, and discuss the advantages/disadvantages of different processing models via a range of phenomena, mainly including cases of morphosyntax and semantics-pragmatics. 
The focus will be placed on evaluating different views of the language architecture, lexical retrieval, syntax-semantic interface, ambiguity resolution, and contextual impact during online computation. In addition, we will explore the relationship between the linguistic system and nonlinguistic cognition (e.g., social cognition, memory, and cognitive control), discussing how these components interact to shape the patterns of language processing.
