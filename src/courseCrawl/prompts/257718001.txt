##  課程簡介Course Description
This course applies statistical methods and economic theory to identify, estimate, and test economic models in the real estate market. This course covers concepts and techniques relevant to the empirical analysis of the real estate market. The emphasis of the course is on various empirical applications. Topics covered in this course include the classical single-equation regression model, multiple regression models, and models with dependent variables that are discrete or categorical in nature. In the lectures, numerous empirical examples will utilize diverse datasets and applications that emphasize real-world data and models. During classes, theory and empirical exercises are combined and practiced. Students are expected to be active and read materials in advance. We will use the SAS software program to solve the empirical exercises and assignments.
