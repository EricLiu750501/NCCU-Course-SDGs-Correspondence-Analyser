You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This is the first of a two-semester sequence of introductory courses in econometrics, with a primary focus on linear regression analysis with cross-sectional data. The purpose of this course is to equip students with the knowledge and practical methods for analyzing economic data, testing economic hypotheses, and measuring empirical relationships between economic variables. We will closely follow Chapters 1-8 of Wooldridge's _Introductory Econometrics_. We will introduce instrumental variables and two-stage least squares (Chapter 15) if time permits. We will use R as the statistical software for this course.
Prerequisites : Two semesters of Calculus and two semesters of Statistics.
  * Simple college-level algebra such as equations involving Sigma notation should not present any difficulty for you.
  * You are expected to be familiar with most of the material in Appendices A–C of Wooldridge's text, though a brief review will be provided. In particular, a clear understanding of sampling distributions, statistical inference, and hypothesis testing is essential.
  * While prior knowledge of linear algebra is not required, we plan to work with basic matrix algebra (Appendix D of Wooldridge's text) in our treatment of multiple regression analysis.
