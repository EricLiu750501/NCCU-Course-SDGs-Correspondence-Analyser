##  課程簡介Course Description
This graduate seminar provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of the political economy of contemporary China. It examines the main theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of Chinese economic reform. After more than four decades of reform, China has emerged as one of the world's leading economic powerhouses. In the course of reforming its economy, China has experienced the fastest economic growth and social transformation in human history. To what extent, however, does China’s development follow the orthodox recipes prescribed by the literature on political economy? What exactly is the source of China’s economic growth over the past decades? What is the current state of the market institutions in China? How do we interpret China’s ascendancy economically and politically? How does Sino-U.S. competition affect China’s rise in the international economic system?
