##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes
This 16-week course provides a comprehensive framework for learning news reporting and writing to non-native English speakers. The course also allows for deeper exploration of topics, more practical applications, and ongoing language support, ensuring students not only grasp journalistic concepts but also improve their English language skills in a very supportive environment.
At the juncture of unprecedented changes never seen before, shall the traditional teaching and learning English-language News Reporting and Writing be necessary for students? Some students may be hesitant to select the course, because they think generative AI can provide help and can be extremely helpful and instrumental. To answer the one-million-dollar question, all major studies indicated that ChatGPT cannot, and will not, replace teachers for various reasons, such as AI is still premature in handing human interactions, obvious accuracy and bias risk, and a lack of understanding of context.
With that in mind, we firmly believe that News Reporting and writing is irreplaceable for all students major in journalism. Then comes the second question, why bother to take extra courses of English-language reporting and writing, since we have already taken class after class of news writing and reporting in Chinese.
Other than language itself, due to different concepts and working models, the writing styles of Taiwan and Western countries are not totally identical.
In addition, the ever-changing digital technology upends news media landscape and ecology and pose extreme challenges to students in J school. Traditional academic teaching is inadequate to equip students to cope with the daunting tasks they will take in the future. I therefore hope that my background as a veteran journalist can compensate that inadequacy by highlighting these uniqueness listed below:
  * The utmost important goal of the class is to build students’ all-round (全方位)global perspective and encourage them to be proactive in pursuing their career, particularly in the field of international news.
  * With almost 20 years of experience in covering global news in strategic locations such as Washington DC, San Francisco, and Geneva, Switzerland, my teaching will emphasize on empirical experience rather than on textbooks, classroom theories, giving students real sense of competitiveness in journalism.
  * Through reading, lectures, discussions, assignments, on-site practices, and presentations will gradually develop their communications skill and writing technique, which are vital to their career.
  * Through more discussion and dialogue than mere lecturing in the classroom, students will be become more confident, independent, and critical, which are required quality for successful journalists.
“Learning by doing” is the motto of the class.
