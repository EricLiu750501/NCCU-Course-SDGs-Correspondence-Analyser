You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
Principle of Economics is a year-long course (3 credits for each semester) that provides an introduction to basic economic principles and methods of economic analysis. The goal of the course is to equip students with basic economic concepts and techniques to apply to daily economic activities and related policy implications.
In the first semester, we concentrate on Microeconomics, the study focuses on the optimizing behavior of individual consumers and firms and the coordination of these individual decisions through markets, including the evaluation of market outcomes. Topics include the theory of the consumer, the theory of the firm, perfect competition, monopoly, monopsony,and oligopoly, markets with asymmetric information, and externalities and public goods. 
In the second semester, we concentrate on Macroeconomics, the study of the economy as a whole. Topics include the theory of the determination of national income, employment, prices, and interest rates; related issues of economic growth, fluctuations, and inflation; monetary and fiscal policy; exchange rate and international trade.
