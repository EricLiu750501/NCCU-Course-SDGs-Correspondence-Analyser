You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course has two main objectives. First, it develops students' ability to use labor economics theory to analyze past and ongoing changes in labor markets. Second, it introduces key empirical facts and evidence about work, wages, and employment, highlighting how economists use data to evaluate labor market outcomes and policies. While students are not expected to conduct advanced statistical analyses, the course will help them understand the basics of empirical reasoning, interpret research findings, and appreciate the role of evidence in testing economic theories. Special attention will be given to current and emerging challenges in labor markets, with frequent discussion of the potential impacts of labor market policies.
