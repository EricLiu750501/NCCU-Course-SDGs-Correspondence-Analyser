You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course offers an introduction to statistics for undergraduate students with no prior background in the subject. As a foundational discipline in data science, statistics equips students with the essential tools and language needed to analyze data and communicate effectively with professionals in related fields. Statistics is about summarizing, interpreting, and making predictions about real-world phenomena through data.
In today’s data-rich world, the volume and frequency of data collection are rapidly increasing due to technological advancements. This course introduces students to fundamental statistical concepts. Topics covered in the first semester include descriptive statistics, classical probability, random sampling, point estimation, confidence intervals, and one-sample hypothesis testing.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
  1. Understand the role of statistics in scientific reasoning and data analysis, and explain key concepts such as populations, samples, random variables, probability distributions and parameters.
  2. Summarize and visualize data using descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency, variability, tables, and graphical displays.
  3. Understand the principles of statistical sampling and estimation, including the concept of a sampling distribution, point estimation, and construction of confidence intervals.
  4. Formulate and evaluate statistical hypotheses using one-sample tests (e.g., z-tests and t-tests), and interpret results in context.
  5. Communicate statistical findings effectively, recognize limitations of statistical methods, and critically evaluate statistical claims in everyday life.
