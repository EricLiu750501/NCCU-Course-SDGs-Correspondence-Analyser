You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course on Spatial Decision Making introduces students to the principles and tools of decision theory through a hands-on approach. The course begins with simple, non-spatial decision problems to build a foundation in structured decision-making, using techniques such as multi-criteria analysis, weighting methods, and regression models.
The second half of the course emphasizes applied problem-solving using Geographic Information System (GIS) software and its integrated modeling tools. Students will engage in practical labs focused on real-world spatial challenges—such as facility sites and infrastructure planning, identifying hazard zones, or evaluating land-use policy scenarios. Along the way, students explore how Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) are built, adapted, and assessed to meet different decision-making needs.
Machine learning methods incorporating decision trees, logistic regressions and clustering are introduced in the context of detecting and analyzing patterns in decision behaviors. In addition, spatial machine learning models and feature ranking strategies offer a state-of-the-art complement to classical analytical approaches. 
By the end of the course, students will not only know how to use GIS and its integrated tools, but also how to design and evaluate spatial decision workflows from the ground up and how to critically assess the decision process in terms of robustness.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Students will learn about existing spatial decision-making projects from the literature, learn how to select useful projects, collect and model data, how to develop workflows and how to arrive at conclusions based on a set of variables and their critical assessment and judgment. 
They will be able to create a targeted decision making system from scratch using Geographic Information System software and their own spatial data model.
##  每周課程進度與作業要求 Course Schedule & Requirements
Classes are 3 hours and take place in the GIS lab (270610). 
Due to the practical nature of this course, we will follow a hybrid approach with mixed theory and practice.   
This course and all handout/upload material are provided in English, therefore a basic command of the English language will be required. 
Also, a basic understanding of spatial data and a feeling for spatial information and relationships are of advantage. Basic knowledge of, and experience with (a) GIS and (b) database management systems are welcome but not required.
