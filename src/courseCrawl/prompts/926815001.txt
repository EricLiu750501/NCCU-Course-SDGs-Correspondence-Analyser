##  課程簡介Course Description
China, Africa, and their diasporas have similarities and differences, many of them the products of interconnections or overlapping experiences. Through the lenses of history, art, politics, and economics, this anthropology seminar compares these two cultures complexes and highlights the hybrid and creative results of their interaction, with the special goal of correcting existing misunderstandings and facilitating thoughtful cooperation in the future. While the professor will orient the discussion around current anthropological methods of critical analysis, the seminar format will require the professor and all of the students to build on and contribute to each other’s understanding of the topic.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course aims to guide students in critically comparing the cultural dynamics of China, Africa, and their diasporas through history, art, politics, and economics. Students will learn current anthropological methods to identify misunderstandings and hybrid outcomes, and collaboratively deepen their understanding of intercultural interaction and future cooperation through seminar-based discussion.
##  每周課程進度與作業要求 Course Schedule & Requirements
Requirements:
1) Weekly attendance and vocal participation in the seminar are mandatory, except in cases of illness or pre-authorization by the professor. Using your distinctive knowledge, experience, and perspective, teach the rest of us something, and listen well to others in the seminar so that we can build on each other’s understanding. During the first ten weeks of the semester, each student must make a 10-minute in-class oral presentation of his or her personal research —ideally including participant-observer research on a relevant population. Ideally, it should benefit from the relevant non-required readings in the Moodle system folder (see below). Please give special attention to the readings at the end of this syllabus, which are so useful that the professor would have required them in a 13-week class with weekly lectures, a course of the sort that he would teach on this topic at my home institution (20% of the final grade). 
2) A one-page, double-spaced, 12-point-font reflection paper in English will be due every week , by 4 p.m. on the Monday before the lecture. It must be based upon a thorough reading of all of the required readings on the syllabus. All required readings are available in a Moodle system file to which all students in the class will have access. Please let the professor know if you are unable to locate the optional readings. 
The reflection essay should begin with an epigraph —ideally the one- or two-sentence passage from the week’s readings that most unsettled your previous thinking about the topic of the week. 
Your essay must demonstrate a careful reading of all of the required readings, as well as your own critical thinking and efforts to contextualize the readings in terms of the rest of the course and what you learn about the authors based upon online sources. 
In the first two-thirds of the essay, critically summarize the argument of each required reading individually and then identify points of tension among the readings. In other words, how do the lessons or implications of each reading differ from the lessons and implications of the other readings. Each summary should begin with “[Author’s name] argues that….”
The final third of the essay should specify how the week’s readings have added to your understanding of the previous lectures and readings in this seminar. Please also feel free to record your remaining questions about the topic of the week’s readings and to address the relevance of the readings to the potential topic of your midterm essay. From the start of the course, you should be thinking about that topic.
For extra credit, you may submit, in an addendum, critical summaries of any optional readings. This addendum should not exceed a quarter of a page in English. Please let the professor know if you are unable to locate any of the optional readings that you would like to review. 
No late reflection essays will be accepted for credit, but you will be excused for one non-submission. However, the professor recommends that you complete them all. 
Please submit your essays as editable MS-Word attachments , not PDFs, Google docs, etc.
Please pay close attention to all of these instructions.
4) Familiarity with the “flipped” lecture notes. On each Monday evening of the semester, after you have submitted your weekly written reflection essays, I send you the “flipped” that will be the basis of my Wednesday lecture. Please preview them, open them at the start of class, ask for any necessary clarifications during class, and review them after class to make sure you have understood the contents and the goals of the lecture. My intention is for you not to read the flipped notes until after you have written your own reflection essays. This intention is one reason that no late reflection essays will be accepted for credit.
5) A written mid-term essay about an aspect of the historical, cultural, political, and economic relationship between China and Africa and between their diasporas. This examination must expressly demonstrate your mastery of the course readings, as well as your own synthetic and critical analysis of them. For further explanation, see Week 11 on this syllabus (40% of the final grade). 
6) A written final examination(40% of the final grade).

Section VII: Present and Futures
7.1 (Week 14,December 3): Understanding Scientific Racism and its Contemporary Replications?
Ani, Marimba. (1994). Yurugu: An African-Centered Critique of European Cultural Thought and Behaviour. New Jersey: Africa World Press Inc. Yurugu - Dr Marimba Ani. (start @19:20)
This seminal work provides an African-centered critique of the foundational values of racial theorisation. Marimba Ani introduces the concept of “ _asili_ ” as the core (defining character) of Western culture, to argue that European culture is inherently dominated by “asili”. This cultural core (_asili_) is characterised by separation, control, and domination – traits that underlie imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism, and global white supremacy. 
Shih, Shu-mei. 2013. “Race and Revolution: Blackness in China’s Long Twentieth Century.” _PMLA_ 128 (1): 156–62.
This piece theorises the racial dynamics of China’s revolution with the help of a novel, Ferdinand Oyono’s _Une vie de boy_ (1956). It argues that ‘Blackness’ is within China’s long twentieth-century history of revolution, sovereignty, and racial politics. While Chinese nationalism presents itself as a response to Western imperialist racism, the piece highlights that China has developed its own racialised nationalist ideologies. From the late Qing to the Maoist era, racial thinking – though often overshadowed by narratives of national victimhood – was central to China’s revolutionary and internationalist projects, including solidarity with formerly colonised peoples.
7.2 (Week 15,December 10): Decolonising Africa-China Cultural Futures
Grosfoguel, Ramon (2010). “The Epistemic Decolonial Turn: Beyond Political-Economy Paradigms”. In: Mignolo, Walter & Escobar, Arturo (eds.) _Globalization and the Decolonial Option_. (Ch. 4).
This collection discusses alternatives to globalization through decolonial perspectives. Specifically, Grosfoguel discusses how impossible it is to, speaking figuratively, use the master’s tools to dismantle the master’s house’, by highlighting how even acclaimed critical traditions sometimes fall into epistemic trap.
Ndlovu-Gatsheni, Sabelo J. (2018). “Seek ye epistemic freedom first”. In: Ndlovu-Gatsheni, Sabelo J. (ed) Epistemic Freedom in Africa: Deprovincialisation and Decolonisation. London: Routledge. (Ch. 1). 
The volume discusses recentering engagements of cultures and peoples by recognising multiple locales, not one, as essential to decolonising human interactions. Chapter 1 distinguishes between academic or intellectual freedom from epistemic freedom. The latter, for him, holds the key and marks the beginning rebuilding futures beyond hegemonic contraptions.
