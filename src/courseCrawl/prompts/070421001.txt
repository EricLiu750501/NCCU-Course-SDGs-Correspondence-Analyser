You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Data mining serves as a crucial field that leverages advanced algorithms to reveal hidden, yet invaluable insights buried within extensive datasets. These algorithms are drawn from a multitude of areas such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, statistics, and database systems, working together to facilitate a deeper understanding and analysis of data. This course is designed to equip you with the foundational knowledge and hands-on experience needed to delve into the expansive world of data mining. Whether you are looking to enhance your skill set or embark on a new career path, this course will serve as a stepping stone to achieving your goals. The curriculum encompasses a range of topics that will introduce you to the core concepts and techniques prevalent in the field of data mining. These include:
  * Association Rules: Understand the principles behind identifying rules that highlight relationships between seemingly independent data in a database.
  * Clustering: Learn about grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.
  * Classification: Gain knowledge on the procedures for identifying the predefined class of a new observation.
  * Text Mining: Equip yourself with the skills needed to analyze and interpret large collections of text data to extract meaningful information. 
  * Data Mining Applications: Explore the various practical applications of data mining across different industries and sectors.
