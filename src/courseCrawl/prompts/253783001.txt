##  課程簡介Course Description
This course is divided into three sections: The first section provides an overview of the Middle East, introducing students to both the theoretical and historical foundations of Islam and the Greater Middle East. Through selected readings, students will develop a basic understanding of the region’s history, culture, and politics. Additionally, the course covers the three mainstream international relations (IR) theories—realism, liberalism, and constructivism—which are widely used by regional analysts and IR scholars to study Middle Eastern affairs.
The second section explores topics related to international political economy, identity politics, and securitization. The selected readings demonstrate how material interests, along with social and cultural factors, shape both political and security dynamics in the Middle East. The third section focuses on key contemporary issues discussed by academics and policy practitioners, including: the Arab-Israeli conflict, the U.S.-led war on terror, the rise and fall of the Islamic State (IS), the humanitarian crisis in Syria, the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis, and the 2023 Gaza War.
