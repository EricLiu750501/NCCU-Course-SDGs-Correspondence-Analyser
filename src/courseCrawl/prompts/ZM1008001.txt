You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course is designed to accommodate three types of overseas experiences for GCIT students: 1) those who obtain their own internships with an overseas company, 2) those who will work with the OIC to go on a study exchange abroad for a semester, attend an intensive course, or attend a summer/winter school, 3) other, such as international volunteering and topical field work or research visits. All of these must consist of one month minimum overseas. In all cases, students will have to report to the supervisor of this course regularly, although there will be no set class time. Evaluation will consist of pass or fail based on the successful completion of one of the three ‘projects’ in the course (referring to the internship, exchange, or fieldwork). The goal of the course is for students to gain first-hand experience with media overseas, and it is subsidized to the amount of 120,000NTD. Students therefore must have an excellent proposal that caters to GCIT’s goals as a program and this proposal must include the name and contact information of a mentor/supervisor who can evaluate your performance while you are overseas.

##  每周課程進度與作業要求 Course Schedule & Requirements
The requirements will vary based on which of the options the student pursues. For the internship, the same rules as the domestic internship course apply, only within a one-month span. For the exchange, the duration must be at least one month long. For fieldwork, the student must present a proposal to the supervising party explaining why they are undertaking the fieldwork. For GCIT-organized internships and events, students must abide by the rules provided by GCIT and the organizing party, if other parties are involved. All students must complete a report about their work to be presented at the beginning of the following semester and a supervisor evaluation is also required (see FAQ and attached documentation).
