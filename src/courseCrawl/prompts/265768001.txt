You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
With the transformation of the population structure, Taiwan has entered an aged society. However, issues such as how the elderly and their families face end-of-life and death-related topics (e.g., hospice care, inheritance, and succession) and the expression of sexual awareness among institutionalized elderly are rarely discussed in Taiwan.  Due to the increasing proportion of the elderly population, at the micro level, the needs of elderly individuals and their families for health care and social welfare have become increasingly urgent and diversified. At the macro level, government expenditures on successful aging, health care, long-term care, and elderly economic security have continuously increased. Among these, the introduction of migrant care workers has also affected care arrangements and the quality of care. Many developed countries and international organizations have successively put forward relevant policy responses to the phenomenon of population aging. In the face of the diverse welfare needs brought about by population aging and potential challenges such as health issues, poverty, protection (against abuse, fraud, and neglect), housing arrangements (social housing, rent subsidies), dementia, long-term care expenditures, and care for conditions like strokes, falls, and traffic accidents, this course will introduce theories and discourses related to geriatric sociology and social work, even involving interdisciplinary cooperation (such as law, criminology, public health, and labor).  In addressing the challenges faced by individuals, families, society, and the country in an aged society (including health, housing arrangements, elderly economic security, long-term care, exercise promotion, leisure, and social participation), through dialogues on elderly-related theories and analysis of current elderly welfare policies, regulations, administration, and practical work, students' sensitivity to elderly welfare issues and their professional knowledge of elderly needs analysis and welfare services will be enhanced. It is also expected that students can apply what they have learned to fields related to elderly welfare work or research.

  3. Enhance students' training in research on issues related to elderly welfare services, and foster and improve their ability to apply such knowledge in practical elderly welfare work.
