You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course introduces undergraduates to the fundamental terminology, concepts, interpretation, and communication of the descriptive and inferential statistics most commonly encountered in scientific research. Learning statistics is like learning an everyday language that is widely used in the scientific community. For example, many researchers use surveys, public opinion polls, censuses, and other quantitative data sources to document, describe, and explain a wide range of social phenomena. To join the conversations being conducted in this realm of research, you must be literate in the vocabulary of research, data analysis, and scientific thinking. Knowledge of statistics will enable you to understand professional research literature, communicate with experienced social scientists, conduct quantitative research, and help you access the growing body of social science knowledge. Additionally, the course will enable students to learn how to utilize data from international data archive projects, such as the World Value Survey, the International Social Survey Program or the Asian Barometer, to explore significant social or political issues in the region.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course is a required foundational course for all students at the International College of Innovation. It introduces students to the essential statistics tools and shows how they are used to analyze quantitative data. A fundamental understanding of these tools is a critical foundation for scientific research. The course covers descriptive statistics, inference from samples, hypothesis testing, and various basic statistical analyses. The course will also introduce R, a free software for statistical computing and graphics. You will need to bring a laptop or notebook to the class to use R.  We will have practice time to use R almost every week. Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to complete the following tasks: 1. Explain basic concepts of statistics (e.g., population vs. sample, sampling distribution). 2. Summarize numeric data by computing descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, variance) and creating tables and graphs. For each procedure, you will learn a hand calculation method (using calculators) and a computer method (using software such as R). 3. Compute various inferential statistics (e.g., t-score) using hand calculation and computer methods. 4. Apply probability theory to test research hypotheses. 5. Explain the differences among various statistical techniques and identify an appropriate method for a given set of variables and research questions.
