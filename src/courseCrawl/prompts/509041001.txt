You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course is entirely taught in the German language by a native speaker. Students will get to know classical German authors as well as some of their most important literary works.* Some of the commonly used terms in German literature studies will be introduced. We will chronologically read and discuss a lot of exemplary German literature of many epochs in this course.
1) The planned content of this course (see the program below) needs to be carefully prepared by every student. Firstly, students have to work and find the vocabulary by themselves to be able to understand and discuss the different German literary texts. Therefore, it is necessary that every student prepares the announced program before every class by reading the assigned German literary text(s) in advance. (Students should write down difficult words and phrases, and/or possible questions to ask in the next session. This is always the assigned homework for any student in this course.)
2) It is expected that students write their own protocol of each class session that later can be used as a preparation for the important final written examination.
3) Following the first two sessions, students will make a presentation at the beginning of every class (each time a different topic by a different student; usually in pairs), introducing thereby one specific German language author, his/her literary work(s) and time.
After the oral presentation by one or more student(s), each session will consist of:
Q & A for the student presenter(s),
reading content description and original German language excerpts with the teacher,
conclusion/opening up of new questions.
Weekly mandatory homework: assigned readings (from the work sheets on the e-moodle learning platform) as preparation for the next session. NCCU encourages students to self learning.
*This course will continue in the second semester with other literary topics and leads to examples of contemporary German language literature.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Through this course, students will have opportunities to get to know German language literature and cultures at a college level first hand. The goal of this course is to exemplarily introduce the development and transformation of German language literature, including some of the most important German language authors and their works. At the same time, using the German language on a more advanced level, the students will get used to read and discuss selected German literary texts and excerpts from different literary trends and epochs of the so-called “history of literature”in this course. In this way, they will start to get a first overview of different texts by influential male and female German language literary authors. Taking part in this course will mainly strengthen students’ reading skills, as well as their listening, conversational and writing skills in German language. Students are also expected to obtain at least the level of B1 according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).
