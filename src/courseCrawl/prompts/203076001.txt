##  課程簡介Course Description
This course is an overview of international economics, and introduces students to basic concepts, theories, and policies on international economics. The first half of this course is focused on the most important issue in international economics—trade. We will cover a number of well-known trade models and trade policies, and discuss how they are applied to or functioning in the real world. The second half of this course is about international finance and macroeconomics. We will discuss issues such as exchange rates, capital control, financial globalization, and economic crisis. While this course is quite theoretical, we will use real-world examples (such as Trump’s tariffs) to illustrate international economics theories, which hopefully will enhance students’ understanding of how international economics works.
