Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:

- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".

The objectives of the module include (1) familiarising the students with the central themes and approaches of political theologies, (2) encouraging the students’ development in thinking critically and writing academically, and (3) fostering the students’ awareness and reflection on the relations between religions and world politics.
The design of the assignments, including the essay abstract (mid-term), weekly class presentation, and term paper (end of term), aims to help students to develop the ability to form coherent and succinct arguments, and present them in an articulate, well-informed, academic term paper.
