##  課程簡介Course Description
In this course we critically reflect on disruption to news practices and civic engagement caused by information and communication technologies. In doing so, we hold a historical view of the development of the media, considering _both_ continuity and change in news production and consumption processes. We ask and analyse such questions as ‘In what ways have mass media and legacy news media been transformed in the digital age? How do search engines and social media platforms shape news production processes? What role do journalists play in these processes? How do they imagine and address their news audiences? How do citizens of Taiwan and of other (democratic) societies engage with news? How do they make sense of news values and involve in content creation? What opportunity and risk has artificial intelligence (AI, hereafter) created for journalists and news audiences? How do digital innovations disrupt political communication processes, particularly pertaining to election and war? How do ordinary citizens deal with fake news?’ In our discussion on these questions, we regard digital technological innovation as one of important sites for producing, consuming and communicating news, and for acknowledging (public) values and constructing (civic) identities. Our inquiry into digital disruption to journalism and citizenship therefore goes beyond a matter of technological progress but focuses on the issues of affordances, experiences, identities, social imaginaries, and ethics. Moreover, our examination of these issues will investigate the global nature of digital media and simultaneously involve contextualising national and local cultures.

In this lecture, we will discuss the places of so-called new media in general and of search engines in particular in contemporary news landscape. We will also examine how news audiences from different national contexts, civic/political cultures, and socioeconomic backgrounds engage with news in similar or different ways. In doing so, we will reflect on the meaning of news value and the issue of trust in relation to technological and political developments.
