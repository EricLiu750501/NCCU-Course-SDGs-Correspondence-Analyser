You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

##  課程簡介Course Description
As IPCC notes, reaching net zero anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the next three decades is a requirement to limit warming to 1.5 °C. It would require rapid and far- reaching system transitions in energy, land, urban infrastructure, and industrial systems, which are unprecedented in terms of scale. However, this Hercules ambition is becoming mainstream, countries with net-zero targets together represent 88% of global emissions. Taiwan also announced net-zero roadmap and strategy at Spring, 2022, and make it legally binding. But the fundamental change in all sectors needs a wide portfolio of mitigation options and a significant upscaling of investments.
This course will integrate social and natural science perspectives on the interpretation of climate change impacts and risks, and will progressively guide students towards an interdisciplinary understanding of the topic through a weekly theme. Several interactive tools will be introduced during the course, including 2050 calculator, energy policy simulator, and climate board game, to deepen the knowledge of crucial policy instruments, and role of social engagement.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
Facing climate change's cross-cutting and transboundary impacts, several countries have adopted net-zero targets and corresponding mitigation actions to cope with the situation. Yet, how to go further in terms of “adaptive” capacities and actions so that social systems and infrastructures can be equipped with absorptive, adaptive, and transformative capacities is the primary concern of this course. By inviting relevant experts to discuss the topic, students will be able to gain a cross-disciplinary and multi-faceted understanding of climate resilience and consider the possibility of practical action through group discussions and reports.
Through lectures and in-class discussions, students will learn the different aspects of climate adaptation strategies and be able to conduct a preliminary policy assessment.
