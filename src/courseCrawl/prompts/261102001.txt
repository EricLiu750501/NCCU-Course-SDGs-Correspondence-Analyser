You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
In the past few decades, the studies on social development were highly related to modernisation theory, dependency theory, and world system theory. One of the major research topics was especially related to the issue of economic development in developing countries. However, the current concern of development studies is no longer focused merely on the material abundance of society. Instead, the subject has expanded to broader areas such as human well-being and environmental sustainability. Present-day research on this matter requires trans-disciplinary and solid knowledge to understand the development of human society and culture, both locally and globally. To respond to the above needs, this course integrates the academic legacy of sociology and anthropology, guiding students to travel from reading classics to facing contemporary issues to learn the technique of applying theory to policy. 
This course is designed to introduce major topics of social development. Since global interaction has become a daily routine, this course will be based on a viewpoint of cross-cultural understanding to enhance students’ ability to deal with people and information from diverse backgrounds. We will read materials regarding the following issues: reflection of development theory; political and cultural dimension on economic development; social capital and development; social economy and social innovation; social inclusion and exclusion; urban and regional development; inequality; social protest and new development models.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
This course contains lectures, student presentations, and in-class discussions. These activities are based on reading materials and lecture slides. Apart from lectures, students are expected to summarise readings on the topic(s) they sign-up for at the beginning of the term and present their thoughts (at least 1 presentation, depending on the class size). Students are advised to read before weekly sessions and bring their reflections and questions to in-class discussions. Finally, this course aims to help students think clearly and express their ideas in the term paper about what can and cannot reasonably be said about causal relations within the global political economy’s realms. Assessment will emphasise the importance of analytical perspectives on key social science issues, theories, and policies.
