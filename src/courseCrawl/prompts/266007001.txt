You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course is designed for students who want to apply the knowledge of modern econometrics to practical research questions. We will learn key statistical concepts and research methods that are essential for conducting valid quantitative analysis in the social sciences. In addition to studying the fundamental principles of statistical inference, students will also gain hands-on experience in modern statistical packages and programming tools that are necessary for researchers to comprehend and implement these research designs.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
The objective of the course is to assist students in developing a functional understanding of key econometrics topics and gaining confidence in applying this knowledge to their own research. We will utilize both mathematical methods and empirical datasets to illustrate the empirical strategies employed by researchers. Students will have the opportunity to gain experience in employing these strategies through in-class exercises and take-home assignments.
The course will cover various topics, including but not limited to:
  * Statistics and statistical inference
  * Population and sample comparisons
  * Basics of causal modeling and regression analysis
  * Time-series analysis
If time allows, we will also delve into recent advancements in big data analysis and its application in economics. This will include an overview of high-dimensional data analysis and classification methods.
