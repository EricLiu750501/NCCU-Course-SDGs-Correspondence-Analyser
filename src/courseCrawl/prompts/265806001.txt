Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:

- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".

##  課程簡介Course Description
Course introduction:
_[Please note that this class will be conducted online from the start of the semester till October 17th. The instructor will provide the link for the online classes]_.
This course examines the historical major economic, political, and social changes in the Asia-Pacific economy. These include factors contributing to increases in economic performance, changes in the form of government, technological change (including industrialization), and episodes of integration and disintegration of the global economy. Can there be development outside of a state structure? What is the role of economic organizations of society in development? These are some of the questions that we examine in these, and in so doing, we will survey some of the major theoretical approaches to understanding the politics of economic development.
Emphasis is on institutional changes in how societies organize economic and political activities as well as on variation in development among geographic regions. Using this background, the course takes up some key issues facing nation-states, including foreign trade and investment, debt, aid, and agents of change. Political economy is a core course for any political science degree at any level. The knowledge and the ability to methodically and empirically analyse how politics and economics interact is fundamental in the scientific and empirical study of politics and international relations.
