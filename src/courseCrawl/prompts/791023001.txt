##  課程簡介Course Description
本課程首先介紹工業物聯網及相關技術、發展趨勢，協助學生了解相關應用。接下來介紹工業物聯網之架構及元件，從感知、收集、傳輸、至處理，及相關協定與對應資安議題，讓學生具備工業物聯網全觀認知。課程接續介紹OT營運技術之資安架構、標準、並透過案例說明OT資安防護應用。課程另擬規劃國內工業物聯網相關企業參訪，增進課程產學聯結並促進學生就業觀。
This course first introduces the IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things), the related technologies, and development trends, to help students understand related applications. Next, the architectures and components of the IIoT are introduced, from sensing, collection, transmission, to processing, as well as related protocols and corresponding cybersecurity issues, so that students can have a comprehensive understanding of the IIoT. Then the course introduces the cybersecurity architectures and the international standards of OT (Operation Technology), and illustrates the application of OT security protection through cases. The course also plans to visit IIoT-related enterprise, and include co-lecturing by industry experts, to enhance the connection between industry and academia and promote students' prospects.
