##  課程簡介Course Description
This course looks at digital media through the lens of culture and language and follows sociolinguist and linguistic anthropological frameworks to unpack the meanings of cultural and linguistic practices of digital media in Asian and non-Asian contexts. It also provides interdisciplinary approaches to the topics of intercultural communication, digital discourse and translanguaging from the disciplines of communication, anthropology and linguistics. Digital media comprises both the internet and mobile mass communication. Its content presented in various styles and genres (written, oral and visual) or in culturally-specific repertoires can be transmitted over the internet or social media networks. This course, in particular, examines the impacts of the internet, smartphone, website and social media on interpersonal, intercultural and multilingual communication and networks. 
This course will first discuss the sociolinguistic study of language and media and then explain the anthropological study of digital ethnography and the communication study of digital media. One prioritizes the significance of linguistic practices with fewer interests in considering intercultural contexts; the other looks at the role of culture(s) in meaning-(re)making and identity construction but normally having very-limited analysis on language use. Combining these approaches is meaningful in that it opens a dynamic space for us to foreground and better understand the divergent meanings of digital media practices which are highly influenced by multilingual, multiethnic and intercultural dynamics.
