##  課程簡介Course Description
## Design Thinking for Innovative Talent and Teams
  * ### _build your purposeful career and abundant life_
## INTRODUCTION
_“It’s very satisfying knowing that I am not alone in this journey, I have a group to share my daily achievements and we can support each other. Either listening to each other’s struggles, accomplishments, or giving feedback, cheering up our teammates. Seems like a life consultation, each class allows us to reflect on our path more and more. Thanks for this amazing journey!!”_
_“Thank you for all the support and guidance throughout the course! I’ve really appreciated the way you’ve made the material engaging and accessible. I’m excited to apply what I’ve learned and see how it all comes together. Looking forward to seeing all of you next week!!”_
_“I’m not quite good at speaking in public or talking to someone new, but in the class everyone is very welcoming and warm. The vibes are great, so I can make new friends and try to talk more without pressure. Thanks a lot for having this insightful class!! “_
### Those are testimonials from NCCU DT class 2024!
# For introverts:
About ⅓ of students identified themselves as being introverted before entering the class, and eventually all of them found their own pace and navigated their ways throughout the course journey successfully. In addition, everyone is kind of surprised for being able to make a lot of new friends along the way!
# For those who have a lot of credits to finish and tons of extra-curricular activities to participate in the upcoming semester:
_“I really appreciate the interesting courses that you’ve designed, I never thought I would have this much fun in a college classroom. Thank you!!”_
This is a course for you to rest, to have fun and to create something inspiring for yourself, your team and the world. Most students found it relaxing and recharging to attend our classes.
# For those who doubt their own attendance rate (Am I able to attend most classes of this course?):
Last year 50% of the students attend almost all the classes (100%, or only missed 1 class due to medical reasons).
Only 5% of the students struggled a lot to meet the course standard (Which is, absence for 3 times is a red flag. The 4th time of absence will make you fail in this class = > no credit !!).
In the AI era where uncertainties and ambiguities are our daily routine ,this course equips students with the design thinking (DT) principles and innovative problem-solving tools to build effective teams and thrive in their life and career. The course features five weeks of DT booster, five weeks of life and career design and six weeks of teamwork with DT. The main objective of this course is to empower students to put DT learning into practice. Individually, students can apply DT mindsets and tools to design their own future life. At the team level, students walk through a startup process with team members to tackle important challenges and form potential business. Guest speakers from corporate and startup ecosystems will be invited to our classes to deliver insights and tips of problem-solving and opportunity-finding.
