- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:

##  課程簡介Course Description
課程簡介Course Description
The general theme for this semester of the SELECTED READINGS IN DRAMA course will be Drama and The Other in various manifestations from culture to gender and orientation. Of particular interest will be The Mind and Emotional Fantasy.
Specific texts to be discussed will be decided later, dependent upon the research and reading interests of the students. The approach to the material will be predominately be topical rather than chronological. This is a participatory course consisting of innovative active interaction, not merely lecture. Come prepared to participate.
Note, this is a media based course. There will be literary readings as well as television and film materials related to the topic. Students who miss media presentations will have to make up the viewing material on their own time – the instructor is not responsible for providing copies of media missed from absences.
Students are encouraged to setup an AI English Study Buddy program. You are strongly encouraged to practice your English skills with the AI Buddy outside of class. While you may use AI to assist you, you must always cite sources and be certain to do major work on your own. AI can make an excellent assistant but the work should still be your own.
Students should prepare an online drive (Google Drive is suggested) to upload to in order submit periodically class video assignments and other homework on it.
Obviously, whether we meet in person or online due to pandemic response or other factors will affect some of our course content. Also, obviously, for in-person classes, students may be asked to scan a QR code (in addition to answering roll call as they are different purposes) and wear a mask while observing social distancing. Unless specifically required for pandemic reasons, masks are optional (show common sense and think of others). Be sure to join the class Discord, just in case.  
This course is taught in English in an English environment only. Please note students from outside the English Department who have not taken the prerequisite courses must be able to understand English to an appropriate level for this course.

課程目標Course Objectives
This course examines drama, the development of drama to the present, and current trends in contemporary drama. Students will consider stage drama, television, and film as genre as well as the various subgenres of dramatic presentation. Most of the readings will be photocopies of papers and scripts or in online archival format. The bulk of the material will be related to stage drama from the late 20th to early 21st centuries with particular emphasis on pieces that have accessible cinema adaptations.
This semester will focus predominately upon alienation and "the other" in Western drama dealing with a wide range of contexts and genres. Most of the readings will be in online archival format.
As this is a media-based course so attendance and participation is very important as films, videos, audio recordings, will be used extensively and cannot be borrowed by students after class presentation. We will have a virtual reality and drama component in addition to classic media.

Additionally, students will be asked to participate in critical discussion activities. Students will also present informative talks related to playwrights, actors, and/or directors of note.
Students are Expected to:
For a number of the project assignments, you may work with others. It is very important that all members of a team do their share of the work on time and be prepared on performance or presentation day.
• Punctual attendance is expected. I do take roll every day. It is your responsibility to find out what went on and to make up the work, ask me for handouts, etc. See general course attendance policies.
• Come to class with an open and willing mind. The study of theatre often involves contemplation of controversial material. As students of theatre, it is expected that you will not judge the material but rather attempt to discern the reason behind the expression of ideas.
• Be prepared to participate in class discussions and activities. You must participate fully. While I will not grade on sheer volume, regular and enthusiastic participation is required. The quality of the participation is the most important factor. Quality covers originality or insight demonstrated as well as clarity of communication.
• Read assigned readings by the due date - be prepared to discuss and/or perform.
• Hand in assignments on time. Assignments are due at the beginning of the class period on the due date.
• All students in the class are expected to foster respect, communicate with civility, cultivate the ideas of others, and encourage participation.
• Comprehend that all class activities are vital to the understanding of theatre and should be studied as thoroughly as lecture and reading material.
• Students should prepare a USB drive (16GB or higher suggested) to hand in periodically with class video assignments on it. The drive will be returned the following week after the assigned files have been copied to the course media drive.
