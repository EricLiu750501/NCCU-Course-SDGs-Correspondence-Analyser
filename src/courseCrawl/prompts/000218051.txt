##  課程簡介Course Description
Macroeconimics is a full-year course that covers the determination of income, employment, the price level,  
interest rates and exchange rates in the economy. The economy will be analysed in the short run (e.g. business cycle and stabilization policy) and in the long run (e.g. economic grow th). The insights of Keynesian and classical theories will be integrated. During the course a variety of simple models will be presented. As macroeconomics is an empirical discipline the course will cover case studies and statistical data interpretation. We will especially investigate the difference among countries with different growth performance.
