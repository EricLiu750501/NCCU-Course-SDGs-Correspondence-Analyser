##  課程簡介Course Description
本課程以台灣為觀察範例，使來自台灣、東亞、中南美洲及歐洲學生，回顧東亞自19世紀中期起，至20世紀80年代後期止，在西方衝擊下，於政治、經濟、社會、文化四個面向近代化回應。本課程分為三個時期：近代化初期（1860-1895）; 日治時期（1895-1945）; 中華民國政府威權統治時期 （1945-1987）。近代化初期，本課程探討台灣在清領時期既存之政經結構及社會脈絡，以及中、日兩國於19世紀中後期啟動近代化歷程，對台灣及東亞之影響。其後，本課程介紹日本帝國統治台灣後，推行近代化治理及亞洲主義，對台灣與西太平洋各地的衝擊及其回應。最後，本課程介紹二次大戰後，台灣因冷戰結構以及國共對抗，進入威權統治及經濟、社會結構調整，逐步邁向民主化過程。本課程也探討19世紀中葉以來，分別探討西方在各時期，對東亞/西太平洋區域政治、經濟、社會、文化的衝擊、回應與相互調整，及對當代東亞政治、經濟、社會層面之影響。
This course focuses on the evolution of modernity in Taiwan and East Asia from the mid-19th century to the 1980s. This course analyzes how the concept of modernity was applied to and impacted Taiwanese society in three periods: the late Ching Imperial Rule Period (1860-1895), the Japanese rule period (1895–1945), and the period of strict control by the ROC government (1945–1987).
After the Second Opium War, Taiwan engaged in the global capital market via opening the treaty ports in 1860. The preachers and business people from the west and Asian pacific areas substantially transformed the existing eco-political landscape in Taiwan. The Ching government had implemented modern governing and changed its negative defensive strategies. And the local elites in Taiwan coordinated with the Ching government to aggregate capitals and enhanced their political autonomy. 
After the Sino-Japanese War, in 1895, the Ching Empire ceded Taiwan to Japan. The Empire of Japan established a colonial regime in Taiwan. The Government-General of Taiwan (GGT) used its power to implement modern and colonial governing in Taiwan. In addition to maximizing economic capital in metropolitan Japan, the colonial government also lingered between the strategies of assimilation and non-assimilation. This debate led identity crisis among local elites in Taiwan for social movements.
After World War II, the Republic of China (ROC), dominated by the ruling party, the Kuomintang (KMT), took over Taiwan. After the Chinese Civil War outbreak, the Temporary Provisions During the Period of National Mobilization for Suppression of the Communist Rebellion (temporary provisions) were enacted in 1948, suspending the human rights provisions within the ROC Constitution. In 1949, the ROC moved its central government to Taiwan, transforming Taiwan from a vast territory to a de facto nation. Meanwhile, the ROC government changed the industry to integrate into the global market more optimal, leading to the Taiwan miracle and people consciousness in the 1980s. With the end of the temporary provisions, the ROC revived its constitution in 1991 and turned Taiwan to a new page.
