##  課程簡介Course Description
This course aims to educate students to seize the particular dynamics and political issues within Europe, and also, its relations with other parts of the world. While Europe has undergone significant political transformation since the second World War, its singular course of integration amidst crises and collective community building provides rich subjects for political studies. By the end of the semester, the students are expected to understand the major players in Europe, the unique governance model of the European Union (EU), and the distinctive issues the EU faces. Students are also expected to be able to analyze a given European issue with rightful approaches.

##  課程目標與學習成效Course Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
The first part introduces the particular European political culture and the governance model of the EU. This part of the class will be mainly lecture-giving.The second part looks into the foreign policy of major European actors. The final section will examine the relations between the EU and extra-regional states. Many of the topics will be covered by guest lecturers specialized on the issue. The last 2 weeks will be group presentations by students. Each group is required to select one topic that tackles EU's external relations with one specific actor in the IR, e.g. states, IGOs, NGOs, etc. The presentation will be a situation analysis of the chosen topic, using IR theoretical approaches to test the hypothesis and to present probable developments. Throughout the semester, students’ active participations are expected.
