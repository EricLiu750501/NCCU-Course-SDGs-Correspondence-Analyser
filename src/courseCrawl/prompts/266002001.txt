##  課程簡介Course Description
Economics is the social science that analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. Economics provides a highly analytical and scientific framework to study the world. Applied Microeconomics builds on the theories of an introductory course by utilizing mathematics to more precisely model what we see in the world and including more examples related to economic and social development. The skills gained through this course will provide an opportunity to specialize in applied microeconomic fields, such as Development Economics, Pubic Finance, Natural Resource and Environmental Economics, International Trade and many others.
