##  課程簡介Course Description
GCIT offers a required domestic internship course with two credits (160-200 hour internship) in the Fall semester. This course aims to train students to obtain first-hand experience from Taiwanese new media organizations and technological companies. To cultivate global communication talents, the internship scope covers international news, digital content creation, and mar-tech. These organizations must be based in Taiwan, and students cannot be employed full-time or part-time there. To abide by the policy of the GCIT program, students taking this course must submit application forms and acquire prior approval from the instructor and the GCIT director before the internship. Students may register for the internship course before or after completing the actual internship. To complete this pass/fail course, the requirements include a satisfactory evaluation from the organizational mentor, a ppt presentation for sharing internship experiences, and a final report.
