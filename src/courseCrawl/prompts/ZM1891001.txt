##  課程簡介Course Description
This graduate seminar explores the transformative role of artificial intelligence in human communication. Students will critically examine how AI technologies—from language models and chatbots to recommendation algorithms and synthetic media—are reshaping interpersonal, organizational, and mass communication. The course will use theoretical perspectives to explore questions of agency, authenticity, bias, and power in AI-mediated communication. Students will engage with interdisciplinary scholarship and apply conceptual frameworks to real-world developments in journalism, social media, public relations, and beyond.
