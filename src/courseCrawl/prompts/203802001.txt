This course aims to investigate the various analytical frameworks in the field of international security with a review of the dominant paradigms that affect the contemporary global order. The purpose of this course is to review a wide range of the literature concerning the study of conflict and energy security in international relations, and particularly the theoretical material concerning war and international violence in the region of East and Southeast Asia. By studying the power competitions between two major powers in the region, the US and China, this course will cover the security issues in this region, and also introduce the ‘hub and spoke’ structure under the US alliances, including the discussions on Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia region.
