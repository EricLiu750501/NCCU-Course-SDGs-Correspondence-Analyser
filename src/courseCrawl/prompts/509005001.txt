Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:

##  課程簡介Course Description
This course aims to introduce German at a beginners level. Guided by a native speaker students will gain firsthand experience in communicating in the German language as well as a basic view onto the German culture. Students will practice content-orientated short dialogues for everyday situations with study partners or groups and present them in class. The teacher’s correction of the students’ performance will improve their ability to speak and understand short simple German sentences at the beginners level.
NCCU encourages students to gain self-learning experiences. Students should use additional materials, e.g., visiting the NCCU e-moodle platform, DW Deutsche Welle online learning courses, etc.

Students will learn how to talk in simple standard German and practice exchanging uncomplicated information. 
Weekly homework assignments including previewing the lesson and revising their assignments will be required. Students will work in groups or with study partners. After each chapter an oral test mostly in form of a free-spoken dialogue in German will be given. Each student’s absentee hours must be under 25% of the total scheduled classroom hours; otherwise the student’s results cannot be accepted.
