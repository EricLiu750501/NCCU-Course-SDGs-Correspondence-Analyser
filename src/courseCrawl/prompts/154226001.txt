You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
In this seminar, we will undertake a critical re-reading of the philosophical works of Ernst Cassirer and Nelson Goodman. The German philosopher’s theory of symbolic forms attempts to address the multiplicity of world-presentations in critical continuation of Kant's transcendental philosophy. The world is never simply given, rather it is made by the symbolic activity of the mind. We will look at the development of the early 20thcentury from the idea of one world that has a certain logical structure and that is given to us by elementary experiences in Wittgenstein and Carnap to the idea of a plurality of worlds. The American philosopher Goodman occasionally refers to Cassirer's ideas; he famously claims that “there are many worlds, if any”. Key questions in our seminar will be: How is the basic idea of diverse ways of world-making to be understood? What exactly are symbolic forms? How many symbolic forms are there? How to make sense of the position that there really are different worlds in which objects are constituted differently through symbolic forms? What is the role of cognition in Cassirer’s and Goodman’s approaches? And, finally, what validity can Cassirer's and Goodman's models claim against the backdrop of the East Asian world? How shall we think about cultural differences? Last but not least, Cassirer's treatment of the symbolic form of myth will be critically discussed against the backdrop of Japanese mythology and Chinese interpretations of the Heart-Sutra.
