You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
1. 請特別注意：確定要修讀本課程的同學第一次上課務必一定要準時出席，若無法出席，名額會讓給系統中等候的同學。
2. 關於加簽：為顧及全體同學之學習品質，本課程謹遵循系上對班級人數之規劃，不做額外加簽。
3. 修讀 _教程_ 同學的額外加簽
考量到 本課程為教程之 「中等學校語文領域-英語文專長」的認證科目，且這樣同學系統給的名額較少，所以加簽只針對這樣需求的同學，尤其是畢業在即的同學。加簽名額非常有限，請速寫email給cc教授，說明你目前修讀教程的狀況： cchao@nccu.edu.tw 這樣才會納入名單。(第一點還是適用喔，記得第一次要來上課!)
以兩種方式確定師培身份：
１）請加簽的同學自己提供師培甄選的榜單給老師，作為師培生的證明。
2）請加簽的同學自己寫一張簡單的證明「學生某某某為OOO年錄取之師培生，欲修習語言學習導論，申請加簽」後到師培中心，確認身分是師培生後，師培中心會蓋章證明。
謝謝大家對此課程的興趣。下面是課程的基本介紹，各項細節都還在調整，期能端出優質的課程菜單，所以內容就是個參考喔：

Introduction to Language Learning 語言學習導論 
This course is designed to discuss issues and methods related to learning foreign languages in the current digital era. One reason for learning English or any other foreign language out of the school context in Taiwan has been to enrich lives, not necessarily for the sake of getting a good job. Under this circumstance, we as multiple foreign language learners may need to be aware of who we are as learners, our goals, our journeys, as well as the digital ecology around us in order to learn any language well. The material, methods, and activities in the course are mostly taken from the field of TESOL (Teaching English as a Second or Other Language), but in this course, we basically will focus on how foreign languages are learned. The class does allow you, the class participant, to understand and explore the possibility of becoming a language teacher, if you choose to do so. The major components of the course include language learning/teaching approaches, apps, and internet tools for language learning, as well as ways to motivate ourselves as foreign language learners. All participants are encouraged to learn a foreign language during the course so that we can discuss related issues and support one another as a language-learning community.
