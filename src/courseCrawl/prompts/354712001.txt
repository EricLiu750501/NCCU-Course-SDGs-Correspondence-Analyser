You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.
