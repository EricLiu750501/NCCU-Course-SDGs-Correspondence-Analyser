You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:
- 10.000: Core concept – the course fundamentally contributes to this SDG.
- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".  
- If no evidence is found in the course description, set "evidence" to [] and "evidence_type" to "none".  
- Do not invent content beyond the course information.

##  課程簡介Course Description
The course focuses on digital technology enhanced education innovation and management with applications. Over the past several years, the field of Educational Technology Management has undergone a significant transformation. The advancements in digital technologies have led to new educational paradigms, and the need for efficient management and effective implementation of these technologies has never been more pressing. This course provides opportunities for students to explore these changes and share experiences and knowledge to improve educational technology management practices.
This course will help students to reflect on the role various forms of electronic and digital technology can play in the teaching/learning process and how you can engage these processes in your classroom. Students will become skilled in some of the many digital tools used in today's schools, including MIT’s System Dynamics modelling and simulation-based scenario planning. 
This course also consider how a small-scale Educational Technology research project can be conducted in an education environment. Case studies and project-based learning with Education for Sustainable Development and organizational learning will be reviewed to offer practical tools and applied research strategies to students prior to conducting their own Educational Technology research project.
