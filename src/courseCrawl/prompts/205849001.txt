##  課程簡介Course Description
Numerous studies have pointed out that the nature of climate change is an international and intergenerational externality problem. This human-induced change in the rising global mean temperature is mainly due to the enormous emission of carbon dioxide arising from the combustion of fossil fuels. To date, more than 100 countries have adopted a global warming limit of 2°C or below (relative to pre-industrial times) as a general guideline (IPCC, 2007). That is, the concentration of carbon dioxide should be maintained at a range of 400-450 parts per million (ppm). The major topics will at least include: (1) Prof. Kenneth Boulding's Economics, (2) Waste and Externalities, (3) The Outdated Coase Theorem, (4) Capital Depreciation and Regeneration, (5) Endogenous Growth Theory and Sustainable Growth, (6) Circular Goods and Services, (7) Sustainable Finance, (8) Circular Business Models, (9) Circular GDP, (10) The Circular Economy National Income Accounting, (11) The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and (12) Sustainability Policy. Conceptual and theoretical work will be given equal consideration.
