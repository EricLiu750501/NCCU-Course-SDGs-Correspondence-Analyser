  1. Attendance and Participation


  * If you are unable to attend a class, you must notify the professor via email **before the class begins**. Upon your return, you are required to provide **valid documentation** to formalize your absence. Alternative methods, such as having a friend inform the professor about your illness, will not be accepted. Leave requests must be supported by legitimate reasons; excuses such as travel or taking a driver’s license test will not be considered valid.
  * Attendance will be monitored. Arriving late to class will result in a **one-point deduction** from your final grade. Missing an entire class will incur a **two-point deduction**. Students who accumulate **three absences** will automatically **fail the course**.


  1. Late Work Policy


  * 1 day late (i.e., immediately after the deadline up to 24 hours later): -10%
  * 2 days late (i.e., 24 to 48 hours after the deadline): -25%
  * 3 days late (i.e., 48 to 72 hours after the deadline): -50%
  * 3 days late: -100% (I will not grade the assignment.)


  1. Team Photo and Peer Evaluation


  * Each team for the term project will consist of **five students**.
  * Teams are required to submit a **group photo** that includes the **team number** and the **names of all members**. A bonus point will be added to the final grade for teams that submit their photo on time.
  * At the end of the semester, a **peer evaluation** process will take place. Your final grade may be adjusted based on the results of these evaluations. Poor peer evaluation scores, particularly when compared to high-performing teammates, may result in **failing the course**. This highlights the importance of active, consistent participation and meaningful contributions to the team's efforts, both **in class and outside of it**.
