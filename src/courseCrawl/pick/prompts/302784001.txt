Sustainable finance has become inextricably integrated into the capital markets in order to support economic growth and reduce environment problem. The financial system is integral to achieving a smooth transition to a low carbon economy. Sustainable innovation is a process where sustainability considerations (environmental, social, financial) are integrated into company systems from idea generation through to research and development and commercialization.
