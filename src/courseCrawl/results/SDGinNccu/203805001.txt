You are an expert in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) classification.  
Your task is to analyze the following university course and assign relevance scores to each SDG.  

Scoring rules:

- 7.000-9.999: Highly relevant – a major focus or significant application area.
- 4.000-6.999: Moderately relevant – a supporting area or minor application.
- 1.000-3.999: Low relevance – only tangentially mentioned.
- 0.001-0.999: Minimal relevance – barely related.

Instructions:
- Always analyze based strictly on the provided course information.  
- Every SDG must include exactly four fields: "reason", "score", "evidence", "evidence_type".

##  課程簡介Course Description
Development is a topic that has fascinated scholars in the social sciences for several decades. In the study of relations between states, and lately incorporating non-state actors, a constant question has been raised: Why some countries develop more than others? What are the elements that can help states and societies to transform and modernize themselves? Multiple answers to those questions have been offered throughout the years. The main goal of this course is to make students more familiar with the different theories and concepts around the decision-making of problems associated with development at the international level. Going beyond the traditional models, which are introduced in the first weeks of the semester, the course also will present students with other topics related to the area of development studies, such as institutions, policies, poverty, inequality, security, and aid, among others.
