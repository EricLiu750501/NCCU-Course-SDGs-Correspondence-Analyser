##  課程簡介Course Description
This course explores the critical role of sustainable development and regional revitalization in fostering vibrant and resilient communities. We will delve into the challenges and opportunities facing rural and marginalized areas, examining how to integrate economic, social, and environmental considerations into local development strategies.
Key themes:
  1. Understanding Local Needs: We will investigate the diverse needs and aspirations of local communities, considering factors such as economic diversification, social equity, environmental protection, and cultural preservation.
  2. Building Sustainable Economies: The course will explore strategies for developing sustainable local economies, including:
  * Community-based tourism: Developing and promoting unique tourism experiences that benefit local communities.
  * Social enterprises: Fostering social enterprises that address local needs while generating social and economic impact.
  * Agroecology and sustainable agriculture: Promoting sustainable agricultural practices that support local food systems and biodiversity.
  * Renewable energy and green technologies: Exploring the potential of renewable energy sources and green technologies in rural communities.
  1. Cultivating Local Talent: We will examine the importance of talent in driving local revitalization, focusing on:
  * Developing local leadership and entrepreneurial skills: Empowering local residents with the skills and knowledge to lead and innovate.
  * Attracting and retaining skilled professionals: Creating an environment that attracts and retains talented individuals in rural areas.
  * Building collaborative partnerships: Fostering partnerships between local communities, government agencies, and non-profit organizations.
  1. Implementing Effective Strategies: We will analyze successful case studies of regional revitalization initiatives and discuss the key factors that contribute to their success. We will also explore the challenges and limitations of implementing sustainable development projects in different contexts.
Unique Learning Experience through real-world projects:
Dr. Tsai has built the partnership work with Kevin Shih, a Wanhua native and has started a company, Muyu, in 2020 to promote Wanhua's rich cultural heritage through guided tours and various community initiatives. To complement theoretical understanding, the course offers two unique field trips to engage with regional revitalization teams in the Wanhua, Taipei. By interacting directly with practitioners, students will gain firsthand insights into the challenges and successes of regional revitalization projects. This immersive experience will allow students to apply classroom knowledge to real-world situations and develop a deep appreciation for the complexities of sustainable development. Thus students will have the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills to real-world projects, such as creating short videos to showcase Wanhua's unique attractions to a global audience. This innovative approach not only benefits local communities but also enhances the international visibility of Taiwan's cultural heritage.
