Topics include the inner workings of CPUs, memory systems, input/output devices, and the critical interfaces between hardware and software.",
      "This course introduces the fundamental concepts of computer architecture and emphasizes practical implementation. Students will have ample opportunities to apply what they learn through a variety of hands-on examples. By the end of the course, students are expected to identify the basic components of a computer, particularly CPUs and memory systems, and explain how they function from the digital logic level to the operating system level."
