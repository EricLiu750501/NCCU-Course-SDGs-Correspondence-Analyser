##  課程簡介Course Description
Development is a topic that has fascinated scholars in the social sciences for several decades. In the study of relations between states, and lately incorporating non-state actors, a constant question has been raised: Why some countries develop more than others? What are the elements that can help states and societies to transform and modernize themselves? Multiple answers to those questions have been offered throughout the years. The main goal of this course is to make students more familiar with the different theories and concepts around the decision-making of problems associated with development at the international level. Going beyond the traditional models, which are introduced in the first weeks of the semester, the course also will present students with other topics related to the area of development studies, such as institutions, policies, poverty, inequality, security, and aid, among others.

##  評量工具與策略、評分標準成效Evaluation Criteria
This course is elective, and student attendance and participation are vital elements to its passing. Preparation and discussion are therefore highly encouraged. The composition of evaluation is as follows:
  1. _Attendance and Participation_ (30%)


Attendance is a key element in the course, as well as constant participation by students. Throughout the semester, students are required to read the indicated chapters from the course textbook, as well as trying to read the recommended supplementary materials. The instructor will encourage students to participate and share their thoughts on the content of the readings, and to prepare a couple of questions prior to the class. For the first couple of hours, the instructor will provide a lecture on the main ideas and concepts for the selected topic of the day, occasionally combined with a team-based presentation prepared by students on specific study cases. For the final hour of the class, the questions previously prepared and shared by the students will be presented and discussed by all the group. It is expected that through these activities, students can also improve their critical thinking, oral and writing presentation skills.
  1. _Presentations_ (team or individual) (15% x 2)


Depending on the number of students enrolled in this course, the instructor will ask them to form teams and each one will be making two presentations during the semester. Each team will be selecting two topics from the syllabus, and prepare a presentation based on the contents of the additional suggested readings. The team presentations will be between Week 5 and Week 15. The number of teams and their members will be defined in the first weeks of the semester, depending on the total number of students enrolled in this course. Also, depending on the number of members per team, the average length recommended for each presentation will be determined. The team can use audiovisual materials, such as PowerPoint or Prezi files during the presentation; as well as interactive activities at the end of it, to engage the audience, such as the website Kahoot. The score of the presentation will consist in: organization and coordination of the team members (20pts.); content and coherence of the presentation (40pts.); performance of team members during the presentation and time management (40pts.).
  1. _Midterm Exam_ : 15%


  1. _Final Exam_ : 25%


*Make-up presentations will not be granted except in case of emergency and in all cases require a note from your doctor. 
* The instructor does not accept late assignments.
* This class has a zero-tolerance policy against plagiarism. All assignments are required to be in conformity with NCCU regulations.
