    "General Computer Science": {
      "reason": "While the research involves data analysis, it's not fundamentally about general computer science principles.",
      "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computer Science (miscellaneous)": {
      "reason": "This is a broad category, and the paper doesn't directly fit into any specific subfield of computer science. The use of computational tools for analysis might justify a minimal score.",
      "score": 0.01
    },
    "Artificial Intelligence": {
      "reason": "The paper doesn't involve AI techniques like machine learning or natural language processing.",
      "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computational Theory and Mathematics": {
      "reason": "While statistical analysis might be used, the core of the paper isn't about developing new computational theories or mathematical models.",
      "score": 0.1
    },
    "Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design": {
      "reason": "The paper doesn't involve computer graphics or CAD.",
      "score": 0.001

    "Computer Networks and Communications": {
      "reason": "The paper is unrelated to computer networks and communications.",
      "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computer Science Applications": {
      "reason": "The paper likely uses computational tools for data analysis and potentially simulations related to gene expression. This justifies a moderate score.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition": {
      "reason": "The paper doesn't involve computer vision or pattern recognition.",
      "score": 0.001

    "Human-Computer Interaction": {
      "reason": "The paper doesn't involve human-computer interaction.",
      "score": 0.001
    },
    "Information Systems": {
      "reason": "The paper might involve managing and analyzing biological data, which could be considered a form of information system, but it's not the primary focus.",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    "Signal Processing": {
      "reason": "Gene expression data can be viewed as a signal, and some signal processing techniques might be used in the analysis, but it's not a central theme.",
