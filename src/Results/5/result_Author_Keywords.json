    "General Computer Science": {
      "reason": "The author's affiliation with a Computer Science department and expertise in fundamental areas like wireless networks and mobile computing makes this a relevant, albeit broad, domain.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "Computer Science (miscellaneous)": {
      "reason": "This is a catch-all category. While the author's work fits into more specific domains, a small score acknowledges the general connection to computer science.",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    "Artificial Intelligence": {
      "reason": "The author explicitly lists 'artificial intelligence' as an area of expertise. The keywords 'deep learning', 'LSTM', and 'GRU' are all core AI concepts.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "Computational Theory and Mathematics": {
      "reason": "Deep learning models like LSTMs and GRUs rely on mathematical foundations. Traffic flow prediction also involves statistical modeling.",
      "score": 4
