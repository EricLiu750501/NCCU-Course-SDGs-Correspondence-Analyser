  },
  "Abstract": "For smart cities, the issue of how to solve traffic chaos has always attracted public attention. Many studies have proposed various solutions for traffic flow prediction, such as ARIMA, ANN, and SVM. With the breakthrough of deep learning technology, the evolutionary models of RNN, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) models, have been proven to have excellent performance in traffic flow prediction. By using LSTM and GRU models, we explore more features and multi-layer models to increase the accuracy of traffic flow prediction. We compare the prediction accuracy of LSTM and GRU models in urban traffic flow prediction. The data collected in this study are divided into three categories, namely “regular traffic flow data”, “predictable episodic event data”, and “meteorological data”. The regular traffic flow data source is the “Vehicle Detector (VD) data of Taipei Open Data Platform”. Predictable episodic event data are predictable as non-routine events such as concerts and parades. We use a crawler program to collect this information through ticketing systems, tourism websites, news media, social media, and government websites and the meteorological data from the Central Meteorological Bureau. Through these three types of data, the accuracy in predicting traffic flow is enhanced to predict the degree of traffic congestion that may be affected.\n",
