  "Keywords": "Institutional repository; Archive policy; Academic libraries; Preservation service; Use promotion\n",
  "Result": {
    "General Computer Science": {
      "reason": "The author's department is Computer Science, and the expertise includes AI, Robotics, and Computational Linguistics, all of which fall under the umbrella of General Computer Science. Keywords like 'Institutional repository' and 'Archive policy' also relate to general CS principles of data management and organization.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "Computer Science (miscellaneous)": {
      "reason": "Given the breadth of the author's expertise and the keywords, there's a good chance some aspects don't neatly fit into other specific categories, warranting a small score.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "Artificial Intelligence": {
      "reason": "The author's expertise explicitly includes '人工智慧' (Artificial Intelligence), making this a highly relevant domain.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "Computational Theory and Mathematics": {
      "reason": "Computational Linguistics and Social Network Analysis often rely on mathematical and theoretical foundations. AI also has strong ties to these areas.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design": {
      "reason": "There's no direct indication of this domain, but it's possible that some aspects of the author's work in robotics or digital humanities might involve visualization or design tools, though it's not a primary focus.",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    "Computer Networks and Communications": {
      "reason": "Social Network Analysis inherently involves networks. Digital libraries also rely on network infrastructure. Therefore, this domain has some relevance.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "Computer Science Applications": {
      "reason": "The author's expertise in Digital Humanities, Digital Libraries, and Social Network Analysis are all applications of computer science principles. The keywords also point to practical applications in academic libraries.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition": {
      "reason": "While not explicitly stated, robotics and AI can often involve computer vision. However, it's not a central theme based on the provided information.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "Hardware and Architecture": {
      "reason": "There's no direct indication of focus on hardware or architecture. The author's expertise is primarily software and data-oriented.",
      "score": 0.1
    },
    "Human-Computer Interaction": {
      "reason": "Digital Libraries and the promotion of their use (from the keywords) suggest some consideration of how users interact with these systems. Social Network Analysis also has HCI aspects.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "Information Systems": {
      "reason": "Digital Libraries and Institutional Repositories are types of information systems. Archive policies and preservation services are core concerns within information systems management.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "Signal Processing": {
      "reason": "There's no direct indication of signal processing expertise. While it *could* be relevant to some aspects of robotics or computational linguistics, it's not a primary focus.",
      "score": 0.2
    },
    "Software": {
      "reason": "The author's expertise in AI, Robotics, Computational Linguistics, Digital Humanities, and Digital Libraries all heavily rely on software development and design. The creation and management of institutional repositories also involve software.",
      "score": 8
    }
