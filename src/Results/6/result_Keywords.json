  "Abstract": "",
  "Keywords": "Institutional repository; Archive policy; Academic libraries; Preservation service; Use promotion\n",
  "Result": {
    "General Computer Science": {
      "reason": "While not directly focused on core CS concepts, the underlying infrastructure of institutional repositories and preservation services relies on general CS principles like data structures, algorithms, and system design.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "Computer Science (miscellaneous)": {
      "reason": "This category serves as a catch-all for aspects of the keywords that don't neatly fit into other specific CS domains. The management and organization of digital assets within a repository can involve various miscellaneous CS techniques.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "Artificial Intelligence": {
      "reason": "AI could be used for automated metadata generation, content analysis, or intelligent search within the repository, but it's not a primary focus based on the keywords.",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    "Computational Theory and Mathematics": {
      "reason": "The keywords don't directly relate to theoretical computer science or mathematical foundations.",
      "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design": {
      "reason": "The keywords have no direct connection to computer graphics or CAD.",
      "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computer Networks and Communications": {
      "reason": "Repositories are accessed over networks, and communication protocols are essential for data transfer and access. However, the keywords don't emphasize network-specific challenges.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "Computer Science Applications": {
      "reason": "Institutional repositories and preservation services are specific applications of computer science principles to manage and provide access to scholarly content. This is a core aspect of the keywords.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition": {
      "reason": "Computer vision and pattern recognition techniques might be used for content analysis within the repository, but it's not a central theme.",
      "score": 0.1
    },
    "Hardware and Architecture": {
      "reason": "The keywords don't directly address hardware or architectural concerns, although the repository infrastructure relies on underlying hardware.",
      "score": 0.1
    },
    "Human-Computer Interaction": {
      "reason": "Use promotion implies a need for user-friendly interfaces and effective search mechanisms, making HCI relevant. Users need to be able to easily find and interact with the repository's content.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "Information Systems": {
      "reason": "Institutional repositories are fundamentally information systems designed to manage, preserve, and provide access to scholarly information. This is a highly relevant domain.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "Signal Processing": {
      "reason": "Signal processing is not directly relevant to the keywords.",
      "score": 0.001
    },
    "Software": {
      "reason": "Repositories and preservation services are implemented using software. The design, development, and maintenance of this software are crucial. Archive policies are often implemented and enforced through software.",
      "score": 7
    }
