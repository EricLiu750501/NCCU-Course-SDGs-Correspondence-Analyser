  "Abstract": "Many academic libraries are often faced with the challenge of developing and\npopularizing the use of an institutional repository. This paper discusses the various issues\nassociated with providing repository services, and explores the current strategies and \norganizational activities employed by libraries when introducing them. It presents the\nexperiences and results of the National Chengchi University libraries in handling the tasks\nof institutional repository development, promotion, and marketing\n",
