  "Abstract": "Many academic libraries are often faced with the challenge of developing and\npopularizing the use of an institutional repository. This paper discusses the various issues\nassociated with providing repository services, and explores the current strategies and \norganizational activities employed by libraries when introducing them. It presents the\nexperiences and results of the National Chengchi University libraries in handling the tasks\nof institutional repository development, promotion, and marketing\n",
  "Keywords": "",
  "Result": {
    "General Computer Science": {
      "reason": "While the paper focuses on library services, the author's background in Computer Science suggests a general understanding of computing principles relevant to digital repositories.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "Computer Science (miscellaneous)": {
      "reason": "This is a broad category that can encompass aspects of the paper not specifically covered by other domains. The author's expertise is diverse, suggesting a general CS background.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "Artificial Intelligence": {
      "reason": "The author's expertise includes AI, which could be relevant to aspects of repository management such as automated metadata extraction or search optimization, though not explicitly mentioned in the abstract.",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    "Computational Theory and Mathematics": {
      "reason": "Indirectly relevant, as underlying principles of data structures and algorithms are used in repository systems. However, not a primary focus.",
      "score": 0.1
    },
    "Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design": {
      "reason": "Not directly relevant to the abstract or author information.",
      "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computer Networks and Communications": {
      "reason": "Relevant to the accessibility and distribution of the repository's content, but not a central theme.",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    "Computer Science Applications": {
      "reason": "Institutional repositories are a specific application of computer science principles, particularly in information management and access.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition": {
      "reason": "Not directly relevant to the abstract or author information.",
      "score": 0.001
    },
    "Hardware and Architecture": {
      "reason": "Indirectly relevant as the repository needs to be hosted on some hardware, but not a primary focus.",
      "score": 0.1
    },
    "Human-Computer Interaction": {
      "reason": "Important for the usability and accessibility of the repository interface for users. The author's background in digital humanities also suggests an interest in user experience.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "Information Systems": {
      "reason": "Institutional repositories are a type of information system, making this domain highly relevant. The paper discusses development, promotion, and marketing, all key aspects of information systems management.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "Signal Processing": {
      "reason": "Not directly relevant to the abstract or author information.",
      "score": 0.001
