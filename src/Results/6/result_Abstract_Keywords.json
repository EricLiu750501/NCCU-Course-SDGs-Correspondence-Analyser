  "Abstract": "Many academic libraries are often faced with the challenge of developing and\npopularizing the use of an institutional repository. This paper discusses the various issues\nassociated with providing repository services, and explores the current strategies and \norganizational activities employed by libraries when introducing them. It presents the\nexperiences and results of the National Chengchi University libraries in handling the tasks\nof institutional repository development, promotion, and marketing\n",
  "Keywords": "Institutional repository; Archive policy; Academic libraries; Preservation service; Use promotion\n",
  "Result": {
    "General Computer Science": {
      "reason": "While not deeply technical, the paper touches on general concepts related to information management and system implementation, which fall under the umbrella of general computer science.",
