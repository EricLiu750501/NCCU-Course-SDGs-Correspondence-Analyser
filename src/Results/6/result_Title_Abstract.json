  "Abstract": "Many academic libraries are often faced with the challenge of developing and\npopularizing the use of an institutional repository. This paper discusses the various issues\nassociated with providing repository services, and explores the current strategies and \norganizational activities employed by libraries when introducing them. It presents the\nexperiences and results of the National Chengchi University libraries in handling the tasks\nof institutional repository development, promotion, and marketing\n",

  "Result": {
    "General Computer Science": {
      "reason": "While not deeply technical, the paper touches upon general concepts related to digital repositories and information management, which fall under the broader umbrella of computer science.",
      "score": 1.5
    },
    "Computer Science (miscellaneous)": {
      "reason": "This is a catch-all category that can apply since the paper deals with a digital repository, which is a computer science application, but doesn't fit neatly into other specific subfields.",
      "score": 2.0
    },
    "Artificial Intelligence": {
      "reason": "AI is not directly addressed in the title or abstract.",
