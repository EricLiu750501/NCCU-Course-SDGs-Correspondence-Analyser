    "General Computer Science": {
      "reason": "While not directly focused on core CS concepts, the implementation of a digital repository involves general computing principles.",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    "Computer Science (miscellaneous)": {
      "reason": "This is a broad category that can encompass aspects of the project that don't fit neatly into other specific CS domains.",
      "score": 1.0
    },
    "Artificial Intelligence": {
      "reason": "Unlikely to be a major component, unless the repository incorporates AI-driven search or recommendation features, which is not indicated by the title or keywords.",
      "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computational Theory and Mathematics": {
      "reason": "Not directly relevant to the title or keywords.",

    "Computer Networks and Communications": {
      "reason": "The repository is likely accessible over a network, but the focus isn't on network protocols or architecture.",
      "score": 0.2
    },
    "Computer Science Applications": {
      "reason": "This is a key area. Institutional repositories are a specific application of computer science principles to manage and disseminate information.",

      "score": 0.1
    },
    "Human-Computer Interaction": {
      "reason": "The usability of the repository's interface is important for user adoption, making HCI relevant.",
      "score": 3.0
    },
    "Information Systems": {
      "reason": "This is a core domain. Institutional repositories are information systems designed for specific purposes.",
