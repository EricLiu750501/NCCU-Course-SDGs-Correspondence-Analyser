    "title": "Toward Reliable Service Management in Message-Oriented Pervasive Systems"
  },
  "Abstract": "Reliability is one of the key challenges of pervasive systems. Numerous message-oriented architectures and service\ndiscovery protocols have been proposed to support service management in pervasive systems. Nevertheless, few researches have\nbeen done to improve the reliability of pervasive systems. This paper attempts to propose a reliable service management framework by\nformally defining a message-oriented service application model and protocols that facilitate autonomous composition, failure detection,\nand recovery of services. Proposed approaches are realized by constructing a developer’s toolkit that enables rapid-prototyping of\nservices. We evaluate the proposed approach by first proving the reliability property and then conducting experiments on recovery rate\nand performance. The results show that the recovery rate can be greatly improved by the proposed approach. Furthermore, the\nservices developed by using the proposed approach are capable of integrating heterogeneous software/hardware, and can be\ndeployed in dissimilar sites with little efforts.\n",
