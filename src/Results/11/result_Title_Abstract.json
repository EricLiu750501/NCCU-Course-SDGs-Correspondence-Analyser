  "Abstract": "At the kilo- to mega-base pair scales, eukaryotic genomes are partitioned into self-interacting modules or topologically associated domains (TADs) that associate to form nuclear compartments. Here, we combined high-content super-resolution microscopies with state-of-the-art DNA labeling methods to reveal the variability in the multiscale organization of the Drosophila genome. We found that association frequencies within TADs and between TAD borders are below ~10%, independently of TAD size, epigenetic state, or cell type. Critically, despite this large heterogeneity, we were able to visualize nanometer-sized epigenetic domains at the single-cell level. In addition, absolute contact frequencies within and between TADs were to a large extent defined by genomic distance, higher-order chromosome architecture, and epigenetic identity. We propose that TADs and compartments are organized by multiple, small frequency, yet specific interactions that are regulated by epigenetics and transcriptional state.\n",

    "General Computer Science": {
      "reason": "While not directly focused on general computer science principles, the analysis and interpretation of large datasets generated by the microscopy techniques likely involve computational methods and algorithms. Therefore, a low score is assigned.",

    "Computer Science (miscellaneous)": {
      "reason": "This category can encompass aspects of data analysis and visualization that are not specifically covered by other CS domains. The processing of microscopy data and the inference of chromosome organization could fall under this umbrella.",

    "Artificial Intelligence": {
      "reason": "AI techniques, particularly machine learning, could be used to analyze the single-cell data and identify patterns in chromosome organization. However, the abstract doesn't explicitly mention AI, so the score is low.",
