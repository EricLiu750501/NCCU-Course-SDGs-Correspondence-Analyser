    "General Computer Science": {
      "reason": "This is a broad category that encompasses many aspects of the paper. The topic of file placement and performance analysis falls under general computer science principles.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "Computer Science (miscellaneous)": {
      "reason": "This is a catch-all category. While the paper fits into more specific domains, it also has a general relevance to the field.",
