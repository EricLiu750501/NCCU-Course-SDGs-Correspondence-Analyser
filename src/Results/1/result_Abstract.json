    "title": "Effective Database Transformation and Efficient Support Computation for Mining Sequential Patterns"
  },
  "In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm for mining sequential patterns from transaction databases. Since the FP-tree based approach is efficient in mining frequent itemsets, we adapt it to find frequent 1-sequences. For efficient frequent k-sequence mining, every frequent 1-sequence is encoded as a unique symbol and the database is transformed into one in the symbolic form. We observe that it is unnecessary to encode all the frequent 1-seqences, and make full use of the discovered frequent 1-sequences to transform the database into one with a smallest size. To discover the frequent k-sequences, we design a tree structure to store the candidates. Each customer sequence is then scanned to decide whether the candidates are frequent k-sequences. We propose a technique to avoid redundantly enumerating the identical k-subsequences from a customer sequence to speed up the process. Moreover, the tree structure is designed in a way such that the supports of the candidates can be incremented for a customer sequence by a single sequential traversal of the tree. The experiment results show that our approach outperforms the previous works in various aspects including the scalability and the execution time.\n\n\n",
