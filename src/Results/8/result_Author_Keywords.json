  "Result": {
    "General Computer Science": {
      "reason": "The author's affiliation with a Computer Science department and expertise in fundamental areas like computer graphics and information visualization makes this domain broadly relevant.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "Computer Science (miscellaneous)": {
      "reason": "Given the specific expertise and keywords, some aspects might not neatly fit into other defined categories, warranting a small score.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "Artificial Intelligence": {
      "reason": "Figure-ground perception and partial shape matching are AI-related tasks, particularly in the context of computer vision. Style transfer also falls under AI.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "Computational Theory and Mathematics": {
      "reason": "Curve deformation and shape matching often rely on mathematical models and algorithms. Image binarization also involves mathematical thresholds.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design": {
      "reason": "The author's explicit expertise in computer graphics makes this a highly relevant domain. Curve deformation and stylized imaging are core topics.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "Computer Networks and Communications": {
      "reason": "There is no direct indication of relevance to this domain.",
      "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computer Science Applications": {
      "reason": "The techniques described could be applied to various applications, such as image editing, design, or data visualization.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition": {
      "reason": "Keywords like 'Figure-ground perception', 'image binarization', and 'partial shape matching' are central to computer vision. Stylized imaging also has connections.",
      "score": 9
    },

    "Human-Computer Interaction": {
      "reason": "Information visualization directly relates to HCI, as it focuses on how humans interact with and understand data.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "Information Systems": {
      "reason": "While information visualization can be used in information systems, the other keywords don't have a strong connection.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "Signal Processing": {
      "reason": "Image binarization and some aspects of image cropping can be considered signal processing techniques.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "Software": {
      "reason": "The techniques described would need to be implemented in software. This is a general enabling domain.",
