  "Abstract": "",
  "Keywords": "curve deformation; Figure-ground perception; image binarization; image cropping; partial shape matching\n",
  "Result": {
    "General Computer Science": {
      "reason": "The paper touches upon fundamental concepts related to image generation and perception, which are core to computer science.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "Computer Science (miscellaneous)": {
      "reason": "As the topic is somewhat specific and doesn't neatly fit into other major subfields, a small relevance score is appropriate.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "Artificial Intelligence": {
      "reason": "Generating ambiguous images relates to AI's understanding of perception and potentially adversarial examples. It could be used to test or improve AI vision systems.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "Computational Theory and Mathematics": {
      "reason": "Image generation often involves mathematical models and algorithms. The ambiguity aspect might involve information theory or related concepts.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design": {
      "reason": "The paper directly involves generating images, which is a core aspect of computer graphics.",
