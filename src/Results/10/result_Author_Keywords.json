    "General Computer Science": {
      "reason": "The author's affiliation with a Computer Science department and expertise in fundamental areas like data structures and algorithms (implied by data mining and stream data management) makes this a highly relevant domain.",
      "score": 8.0
    },
    "Computer Science (miscellaneous)": {
      "reason": "This serves as a catch-all for aspects of the author's work that don't neatly fit into other specific domains. The keywords and expertise suggest a broad understanding of computer science principles.",
      "score": 3.0
    },
    "Artificial Intelligence": {
      "reason": "Data mining is a core component of AI, particularly in areas like machine learning and knowledge discovery. The focus on data streams also aligns with real-time AI applications.",
      "score": 6.0
    },
    "Computational Theory and Mathematics": {
      "reason": "Hash functions and the distinction between discrete and continuous methods are rooted in mathematical principles and are crucial for data stream processing and data mining algorithms.",
      "score": 7.0
    },
    "Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design": {
      "reason": "While not a primary focus, multimedia information systems can overlap with computer graphics, especially in areas like video stream processing and analysis. However, the connection is relatively weak.",
      "score": 1.5
    },
    "Computer Networks and Communications": {
      "reason": "Stream data management often involves network communication for data transfer and distribution. The relevance depends on the specific application, but it's a plausible connection.",
      "score": 4.0
    },
    "Computer Science Applications": {
      "reason": "The expertise in multimedia information systems, data mining, and stream data management directly translates to various real-world applications, making this domain highly relevant.",
      "score": 9.0
    },
    "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition": {
      "reason": "Multimedia information systems and data mining can be applied to computer vision tasks, such as video analysis and object recognition. However, this is not a central theme based on the provided information.",
      "score": 2.0
    },
    "Hardware and Architecture": {
      "reason": "While not explicitly mentioned, the efficiency of data stream processing and data mining algorithms is often influenced by hardware considerations. However, the provided information doesn't suggest a strong focus on hardware.",
      "score": 1.0
    },
    "Human-Computer Interaction": {
      "reason": "The connection to HCI is weak. Multimedia information systems *could* be related to user interfaces, but it's not a primary focus based on the provided information.",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    "Information Systems": {
      "reason": "Data mining and stream data management are essential components of modern information systems, particularly those dealing with large volumes of real-time data.",
      "score": 7.5
    },
    "Signal Processing": {
      "reason": "Stream data management and the analysis of continuous data streams have strong connections to signal processing techniques. The discrete/continuous method keyword further reinforces this connection.",
      "score": 5.0
    },
    "Software": {
      "reason": "All the listed expertise and keywords imply a strong focus on software development and implementation. Data mining algorithms, stream data management systems, and multimedia information systems are all software-intensive.",
