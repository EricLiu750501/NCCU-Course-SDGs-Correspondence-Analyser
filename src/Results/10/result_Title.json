    "General Computer Science": {
      "reason": "The title describes a fundamental problem in data processing, which falls under the umbrella of general computer science principles.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "Computer Science (miscellaneous)": {
      "reason": "While the topic is specific, it doesn't neatly fit into many other sub-domains, making this a reasonable catch-all.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "Artificial Intelligence": {
      "reason": "Data streams are often used in AI applications for real-time learning and decision-making. Maintaining moving sums could be a component of an AI system.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "Computational Theory and Mathematics": {
      "reason": "The problem likely involves algorithmic efficiency and mathematical properties of sums, making this domain relevant.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design": {
      "reason": "Unlikely to be directly related, unless the data stream represents graphical data being processed in real-time, which is not implied by the title.",
      "score": 0.001
    },
    "Computer Networks and Communications": {
      "reason": "If the data stream is being received over a network, then network considerations might be relevant, but it's not a primary focus.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "Computer Science Applications": {
      "reason": "The title suggests a practical application of data stream processing, making this domain relevant.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition": {
      "reason": "While data streams can be used in computer vision, the title doesn't suggest any specific connection to visual data or pattern recognition.",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    "Hardware and Architecture": {
      "reason": "The efficiency of maintaining moving sums can be influenced by hardware, but it's not the primary focus.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "Human-Computer Interaction": {
      "reason": "Unlikely to be directly related unless the data stream represents user input, which is not implied by the title.",
