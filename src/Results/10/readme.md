Conf: International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications
傳播數據挖掘,跨應用程序,算法,軟件和系統以及具有數據挖掘潛力的不同應用學科的原始研究成果

Software, (3):Computational Theory and Mathematics,  (6): Computer Science Applications

相對分數來看 全部大致相同
- Abstract_Keywords 分數相對低
- 雖然相對分數相同，但是大小很不一樣



- 分歧項
(2): Artificial Intelligence
Author + keywords

**主要是講跟 Data mining 的效率改進問題 但是 author + keyword 沒有提到 導致誤判**
```json
    "Artificial Intelligence": {
      "reason": "Data mining is a core component of AI, particularly in areas like machine learning and knowledge discovery. The focus on data streams also aligns with real-time AI applications.",
      "score": 6.0
    },

```

()Signal Processing
Title + Abstract

確實
```json
"Signal Processing": {
      "reason": "While data streams can represent signals, the paper doesn't focus on signal processing techniques like filtering or transformation.",
      "score": 1
    },

```

keyword
**應該是被誤導了**
```json
    "Signal Processing": {
      "reason": "Data streams are common in signal processing applications. Discrete and continuous methods are fundamental to signal analysis and processing.",
      "score": 6
    },

```

()Software
```json
## Title + Abstract
"Software": {
      "reason": "The proposed methods would be implemented in software. The paper discusses data structures and algorithms, which are fundamental to software development.",
      "score": 4
    }

## Title
"Software": {
      "reason": "The implementation of algorithms for maintaining moving sums falls under software development.",
      "score": 9
    }
```








- overall

細節分析但又有點嚴格 : Abstract 
概觀總覽：Title or keywrord


- 
個人覺得 Abstract + keyword 解釋好
