  },
  "Background\nWith the development of HiC technology, more and more HiC sequencing data have been produced. Although there are dozens of packages that can turn sequencing data into contact maps, there is no appropriate tool to query contact maps in order to extract biological information from HiC datasets.\n\nResults\nWe present HiCmapTools, a tool for biologists to efficiently calculate and analyze HiC maps. The complete program provides multi-query modes and analysis tools. We have validated its utility on two real biological questions: TAD loop and TAD intra-density.\n\nConclusions\nHiCmapTools supports seven access options so that biologists can quantify contact frequency of the interest sites. The tool has been implemented in C++â€‰and R and is freely available at https://github.com/changlabtw/hicmaptools and documented at https://hicmaptools.readthedocs.io/.\n\n",
